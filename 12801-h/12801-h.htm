<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2>EMANCIPATION AND POLITICS</h2>

<p>During the spring and summer of 1861 the
people of the North presented the appearance of
a great political unit. All alleged emphatically
that the question was simply of the Union, and
upon this issue no Northerner could safely differ
from his neighbors. Only a few of the more
cross-grained ones among the Abolitionists were
contemptuously allowed to publish the selfishness
of their morality, and to declare that they were
content to see the establishment of a great slave
empire, provided they themselves were free from
the taint of connection with it. If any others let
Southern proclivities lurk in the obscure recesses
of their hearts they were too prudent to permit
these perilous sentiments to appear except in the
masquerade of dismal presagings. So in appearance
the Northern men were united, and in fact
were very nearly so&mdash;for a short time.</p>

<p>This was a fortunate condition, which the President
<!-- Image No 12 --><a name='Png12'></a><a name='Page002'></a><span class="pagenum">002</span>
and all shrewd patriots took great pains to
maintain. It filled the armies and the Treasury,
and postponed many jeopardies. But too close to
the surface to be long suppressed lay the demand
that those who declared the Union to be the sole
issue should explain how it came about that the
Union was put in issue at all, why there was any
dissatisfaction with it, and why any desire anywhere
to be rid of it. All knew the answer to that
question; all knew that if the war was due to disunion,
disunion in turn was due to slavery. Unless
some makeshift peace should be quickly patched
up, this basic cause was absolutely sure to force
recognition for itself; a long and stern contest
must inevitably wear its way down to the bottom
question. It was practical wisdom for Mr. Lincoln
in his inaugural not to probe deeper than
secession; and it was well for multitudes to take
arms and contribute money with the earnest asseveration
that they were fighting and paying only for
the integrity of the country. It was the truth, or
rather it was <i>a</i> truth; but there was also another
and a deeper truth: that he who fought for the
integrity of the country, also, by a necessity inherent
in the case and far beyond the influence of
his volition, fought for the destruction of slavery.
Just as soon as this second truth came up and
took distinct shape beside the other, angry political
divisions sundered the Unionists. Abolition
of slavery never displaced Union as a purpose of
the war; but the two became mingled, in a duality
<!-- Image No 13 --><a name='Png13'></a><a name='Page003'></a><span class="pagenum">003</span>
which could not afterward be resolved into its component
parts so that one could be taken and the
other could be left. The union of the two issues
meant the disunion of the people of the Middle
and even of the Northern States.</p>

<p>In the Border States a considerable proportion
of the people was both pro-slavery and pro-Union.
These men wished to retain their servile laborers
under their feet and the shelter of the Union over
their heads. At first they did not see that they
might as well hope to serve both God and Mammon.
Yet for the moment they seemed to hold the
balance of power between the contestants; for had
all the pro-slavery men in the Border States gone
over in a mass to the South early in the war, they
might have settled the matter against the North in
short order. The task of holding and conciliating
this important body, with all its Northern sympathizers,
became a controlling purpose of the President,
and caused the development of his famous
&quot;border-state policy,&quot; for which he deserved the
highest praise and received unlimited abuse.</p>

<p>The very fact that these men needed, for their
comfort, reiterated assurances of a policy not hostile
to slavery indicated the jeopardy of their situation.
The distinct language of the President
alleviated their anxiety so far as the Executive was
concerned, but they desired to commit the legislative
branch to the same doctrine. Among all
those who might have been Secessionists, but were
not, no other could vie in respect and affection with
<!-- Image No 14 --><a name='Png14'></a><a name='Page004'></a><span class="pagenum">004</span>
the venerable and patriotic John J. Crittenden
of Kentucky. This distinguished statesman now
became the spokesman for the large body of loyal
citizens who felt deeply that the war ought not to
impinge in the least upon the great institution
of the South. In the extra session of Congress,
convened in July, 1861, he offered a resolution
pledging Congress to hold in mind: &quot;That this
war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of
oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,
nor with any purpose of overthrowing
or interfering with the rights or established institutions
of those [the revolted] States; but to
defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution,
and to preserve the Union with all the
dignity, equality, and rights of the several States
unimpaired.&quot; After the example of the Constitution,
this resolution was carefully saved from the
contamination of a certain offensive word; but
every one knew its meaning and its purpose; and
with this knowledge all the votes save two in the
House of Representatives, and all save five in the
Senate, were given for it.<a name='FNanchor_1_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_1'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
&quot;It was,&quot; says Mr.
Blaine, &quot;a fair reflection of the popular sentiment
throughout the North.&quot; So Mr. Lincoln's
inaugural was ratified.</p>

<p>But events control. The Northern armies ran
against slavery immediately. Almost in the very
hours when the resolution of Mr. Crittenden was
<!-- Image No 15 --><a name='Png15'></a><a name='Page005'></a><span class="pagenum">005</span>
gliding so easily through the House, thousands of
slaves at Manassas were doing the work of laborers
and servants, and rendering all the whites of the
Southern army available for fighting. The handicap
was so severe and obvious that it immediately
provoked the introduction of a bill freeing slaves
belonging to rebels and used for carrying on the
war. The Democrats and the men of the Border
States generally opposed the measure, with very
strong feeling. No matter how plausible the reason,
they did not wish slavery to be touched at all.
They could not say that this especial bill was
wrong, but they felt that it was dangerous. Their
protests against it, however, were of no avail, and
it became law on August 6. The extreme anti-slavery
men somewhat sophistically twisted it into
an assistance to the South.</p>

<p>The principle of this legislation had already been
published to the country in a very fortunate way
by General Butler. In May, 1861, being in command
at Fortress Monroe, he had refused, under
instructions from Cameron, to return three fugitive
slaves to their rebel owner, and he had ingeniously
put his refusal on the ground that they
were &quot;contraband of war.&quot; The phrase instantly
became popular. General Butler says that, &quot;as
a lawyer, [he] was never very proud of it;&quot; but
technical inaccuracy does not hurt the force of an
epigram which expresses a sound principle. &quot;Contraband&quot;
underlay the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

<p>Thus the slaves themselves were forcing the
<!-- Image No 16 --><a name='Png16'></a><a name='Page006'></a><span class="pagenum">006</span>issue, regardless of polities and diplomacy. With
a perfectly correct instinctive insight into the true
meaning of the war, they felt that a Union camp
ought to be a place of refuge, and they sought
it eagerly and in considerable numbers. Then,
however, their logical owners came and reclaimed
them, and other commanders were not so apt at
retort as General Butler was. Thus it came to
pass that each general, being without instructions,
carried out his own ideas, and confusion ensued.
Democratic commanders returned slaves; Abolitionist
commanders refused to do so; many were
sadly puzzled what to do. All alike created embarrassing
situations for the administration.</p>

<p>General Fremont led off. On August 30, being
then in command of the Western Department,
he issued an order, in which he declared that he
would &quot;assume the administrative powers of the
State.&quot; Then, on the basis of this bold assumption,
he established martial law, and pronounced
the slaves of militant or active rebels to be &quot;free
men.&quot; The mischief of this ill-advised proceeding
was aggravated by the &quot;fires of popular enthusiasm
which it kindled.&quot; The President wrote to
Fremont, expressing his fear that the general's
action would &quot;alarm our Southern Union friends,
and turn them against us; perhaps ruin our rather
fair prospect in Kentucky.&quot; Very considerately
he said: &quot;Allow me, therefore, to ask that you
will, as of your own motion, modify that paragraph
so as to conform to&quot; the Act of August 6.
<!-- Image No 17 --><a name='Png17'></a><a name='Page007'></a><span class="pagenum">007</span>Fremont replied, in substance, that the President
might do this, but that he himself would not!
Thereupon Mr. Lincoln, instead of removing the
insubordinate and insolent general, behaved in his
usual passionless way, and merely issued an order
that Fremont's proclamation should be so modified
and construed as &quot;to conform with and not to
transcend&quot; the law. By this treatment, which
should have made Fremont grateful and penitent,
he was in fact rendered angry and indignant; for
he had a genuine belief in the old proverb about
laws being silent in time of war, and he really
thought that documents signed in tents by gentlemen
wearing shoulder-straps were deserving of
more respect, even by the President, than were
mere Acts of Congress. This was a mistaken
notion, but Fremont never could see that he had
been in error, and from this time forth he became
a vengeful thorn in the side of Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>Several months later, on May 9, 1862, General
Hunter proclaimed martial law in Georgia, Florida,
and South Carolina, and said: &quot;Slavery and
martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible.
The persons in these States, heretofore
held as slaves, are therefore declared forever
free.&quot; At once, though not without reluctance,
Mr. Lincoln revoked this order, as unauthorized.
He further said that, if he had power to &quot;declare
the slaves of any State or States free,&quot; the propriety
of exercising that power was a question which
he reserved exclusively to himself. These words
<!-- Image No 18 --><a name='Png18'></a><a name='Page008'></a><span class="pagenum">008</span>
he fully made good. The whole country, wild
with excitement and teeming with opinions almost
co-numerous with its citizens, threatened to bury
him beneath an avalanche of advice. But while
all talked and wrote madly and endlessly, he
quietly held his peace, did what he chose when he
chose, and never delegated any portion of his
authority over this most important business to any
one. He took emancipation for his own special
and personal affair; it was a matter about which
he had been doing much thinking very earnestly
for a long while, and he had no notion of forming
now any partnership for managing it.</p>

<p>The trend, however, was not all in one direction.
While Butler, Fremont, and Hunter were
thus befriending the poor runaways, Buell and
Hooker were allowing slave-owners to reclaim
fugitives from within their lines; Halleck was
ordering that no fugitive slave should be admitted
within his lines or camp, and that those already
there should be put out; and McClellan was promising
to crush &quot;with an iron hand&quot; any attempt
at slave insurrection. Amid such confusion, some
rule of universal application was sorely needed.
But what should it be?</p>

<p>Secretary Cameron twice nearly placed the administration
in an embarrassing position by taking
very advanced ground upon the negro question.
In October, 1861, he issued an order to General
Sherman, then at Port Royal, authorizing him to
employ negroes in any capacity which he might
&quot;<!-- Image No 19 --><a name='Png19'></a><a name='Page009'></a><span class="pagenum">009</span>
deem most beneficial to the service.&quot; Mr. Lincoln
prudently interlined the words: &quot;This, however,
not to mean a general arming of them for
military service.&quot; A few weeks later, in the Report
which the secretary prepared to be sent with
the President's message to Congress, he said: &quot;As
the labor and service of their slaves constitute the
chief property of the rebels, they should share the
common fate of war.... It is as clearly a right
of the government to arm slaves, when it becomes
necessary, as it is to use gunpowder taken from
the enemy. Whether it is expedient to do so is
purely a military question.&quot; He added more to
the same purport. He then had his report printed,
and sent copies, by mail, to many newspapers
throughout the country, with permission to publish
it so soon as the telegraph should report the
reading before Congress. At the eleventh hour a
copy was handed to Mr. Lincoln, to accompany
his message; and then, for the first time, he saw
these radical passages. Instantly he directed that
all the postmasters, to whose offices the printed
copies had been sent on their way to the newspaper
editors, should be ordered at once to return
these copies to the secretary. He then ordered
the secretary to make a change, equivalent to an
omission, of this inflammatory paragraph. After
this emasculation the paragraph only stated that
&quot;slaves who were abandoned by their owners on
the advance of our troops&quot; should not be returned
to the enemy.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 20 --><a name='Png20'></a><a name='Page010'></a><span class="pagenum">010</span>
When the Thirty-seventh Congress came together
for the regular session, December 2, 1861,
anti-slavery sentiment had made a visible advance.
President Lincoln, in his message, advised recognizing
the independence of the negro states of
Hayti and Liberia. He declared that he had
been anxious that the &quot;inevitable conflict should
not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary
struggle,&quot; and that he had, therefore,
&quot;thought it proper to keep the integrity of the
Union prominent as the primary object of the contest
on our part.&quot; Referring to his enforcement
of the law of August 6, he said: &quot;The Union must
be preserved, and hence all indispensable means
must be employed.&quot; The shadow which pro-slavery
men saw cast by these words was very
slightly, if at all, lightened by an admission which
accompanied it,&mdash;that &quot;we should not be in haste
to determine that radical and extreme measures,
which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal,
are indispensable.&quot; Further he said that already,
by the operation of the Act of August 6, numbers
of persons had been liberated, had become dependent
on the United States, and must be provided
for. He anticipated that some of the States might
pass similar laws for their own benefit; in which
case he recommended Congress to &quot;provide for
accepting such persons from such States, according
to some mode of valuation, in lieu, <i>pro tanto</i>,
of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be
agreed on.&quot; He desired that these negroes, being
<!-- Image No 21 --><a name='Png21'></a><a name='Page011'></a><span class="pagenum">011</span>
&quot;at once deemed free,&quot; should be colonized in some
&quot;climate congenial to them,&quot; and he wished an
appropriation for acquiring territory for this purpose.
Thus he indicated with sufficient clearness
the three cardinal points of his own theory for
emancipation: voluntary action of the individual
slave States by the exercise of their own sovereign
power; compensation of owners; and colonization.
Congress soon showed that it meant to strike a
pace much more rapid than that set by the President;
and the friends of slavery perceived an
atmosphere which made them so uneasy that they
thought it would be well to have the Crittenden
resolution substantially reaffirmed. They made the
effort, and they failed, the vote standing 65 yeas
to 71 nays. All which this symptom indicated as
to the temper of members was borne out during
the session by positive and aggressive legislation.
Only a fortnight had passed, when Henry Wilson,
senator from Massachusetts, introduced a bill to
emancipate the slaves in the District of Columbia,
and to pay a moderate compensation to owners.
The measure, rightly construed as the entering
point of the anti-slavery wedge, gave rise to bitter
debates in both houses. The senators and representatives
from the slave States manifested intense
feeling, and were aided with much spirit by the
Democrats of the free States. But resistance was
useless; the bill passed the Senate by a vote of
29 to 14, and the House by 92 to 38. On April
16 the President signed it, and returned it with a
<!-- Image No 22 --><a name='Png22'></a><a name='Page012'></a><span class="pagenum">012</span>
message, in which he said: &quot;If there be matters
within and about this Act which might have taken
a course or shape more satisfactory to my judgment,
I do not attempt to specify them. I am
gratified that the two principles of compensation
and colonization are both recognized and practically
applied in the Act.&quot; It was one of the coincidences
of history that by his signature he now
made law that proposition which, as a member of
the House of Representatives in 1849, he had embodied
in a bill which then hardly excited passing
notice as it went on its quick way to oblivion.</p>

<p>The confused condition concerning the harboring
and rendition of fugitive slaves by military
commanders, already mentioned, was also promptly
taken in hand. Various bills and amendments
offered in the Senate and in the House were substantially
identical in the main purpose of making
the recovery of a slave from within the Union
lines practically little better than impossible. The
shape which the measure ultimately took was the
enactment of an additional article of war, whereby
all officers in the military service of the United
States were &quot;prohibited from using any portion
of the forces under their respective commands for
the purpose of returning fugitives from service or
labor;&quot; any officer who should violate the article
was to be dismissed from the service. Again the
men from the Border States, rallying their few
Democratic allies from the North to their assistance,
made vehement opposition, and again they
<!-- Image No 23 --><a name='Png23'></a><a name='Page013'></a><span class="pagenum">013</span>
were overwhelmed beneath an irresistible majority:
83 to 42 in the House, 29 to 9 in the Senate.
The President signed the bill on March 13, 1862,
and thereafter &quot;nigger hunting&quot; was a dangerous
sport in the Union camps.</p>

<p>On March 24, Mr. Arnold<a name='FNanchor_2_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_2'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
of Illinois introduced
a bill ambitiously purporting &quot;to render
freedom national and slavery sectional.&quot; It prohibited
slavery wherever Congress could do so,
that is to say, in all Territories, present and
future, in all forts, arsenals, dockyards, etc., in
all vessels on the high seas and on all national
highways beyond the territory and jurisdiction of
the several States. Both by its title and by its
substance it went to the uttermost edge of the
Constitution and, in the matter of Territories,
perhaps beyond that edge. Mr. Arnold himself
supported it with the bold avowal that slavery was
in deadly hostility to the national government, and
therefore must be destroyed. Upon a measure so
significant and so defended, debate waxed hot, so
that one gentleman proposed that the bill should
be sent back to the committee with instructions
not to report it back &quot;until the cold weather.&quot;
The irritation and alarm of the Border States
rendered modification necessary unless tact and
caution were to be wholly thrown to the winds.
Ultimately, therefore, the offensive title was exchanged
for the simple one of &quot;An Act to secure

freedom to all persons within the Territories of the
United States,&quot; and the bill, curtailed to accord
with this expression, became law by approval of
the President on June 19.</p>

<p>A measure likely in its operation to affect a
much greater number of persons than any other of
those laws which have been mentioned was introduced
by Senator Trumbull of Illinois. This was
&quot;for the confiscation of the property of rebels, and
giving freedom to the persons they hold in slavery.&quot;
It made the slaves of all who had taken up
arms against the United States &quot;forever thereafter
free.&quot; It came up for debate on February 25,
and its mover defended it as &quot;destroying to a great
extent the source and origin of the rebellion, and
the only thing which had ever seriously threatened
the peace of the Union.&quot; The men of the Border
States, appalled at so general a manumission, declared
that it would produce intolerable conditions
in their States, leading either to re&euml;nslavement or
extermination. So strenuous an anti-slavery man
as Senator Hale also suggested that the measure
was unconstitutional. Similar discussion upon
similar propositions went forward contemporaneously
in the House. For once, in both bodies, the
Democrats won in many skirmishes. Ultimately,
as the outcome of many amendments, substitutes,
recommitments, and conferences, a bill was patched
up, which passed by 27 to 12 in the Senate and
82 to 42 in the House, and was approved by the
President July 17. It was a very comprehensive
<!-- Image No 25 --><a name='Png25'></a><a name='Page015'></a><span class="pagenum">015</span>measure; so much so, that Mr. Blaine has said of
it: &quot;Even if the war had ended without a formal
and effective system of emancipation, it is believed
that this statute would have so operated as to render
the slave system practically valueless.&quot;</p>

<p>The possibility of enlisting negroes as soldiers
received early consideration. Black troops had
fought in the Revolution; why, then, should not
black men now fight in a war of which they themselves
were the ultimate provocation? The idea
pleased the utilitarian side of the Northern mind
and shocked no Northern prejudice. In fact, as
early as the spring of 1862 General Hunter, in
the Department of the South, organized a negro
regiment. In July, 1862, pending consideration
of a bill concerning calling forth the militia,
reported by the Senate Committee on Military
Affairs, amendments were moved declaring that
&quot;there should be no exemption from military
service on account of color,&quot; permitting the
enlistment of &quot;persons of African descent,&quot; and
making &quot;forever thereafter free&quot; each person so
enlisted, his mother, his wife, and his children. No
other measure so aroused the indignation of the
border-state men. Loyalty to the Union could
not change their opinion of the negro. To put
arms into the hands of slaves, or ex-slaves, was a
terrible proposition to men who had too often
vividly conceived the dread picture of slave insurrection.
To set black men about the business of
killing white men, to engage the inferior race to
<!-- Image No 26 --><a name='Png26'></a><a name='Page016'></a><span class="pagenum">016</span>destroy the superior race, seemed a blasphemy
against Nature. A few also of the Northerners
warmly sympathized with this feeling. Black men
shooting down white men was a spectacle which
some who were friends of the black men could
not contemplate without a certain shudder. Also
many persons believed that the white soldiers of
the North would feel degraded by having regiments
of ex-slaves placed beside them in camp and
in battle. Doubts were expressed as to whether
negroes would fight, whether they would not be a
useless charge, and even a source of peril to those
who should depend upon them. Language could
go no farther in vehemence of protest and denunciation
than the words of some of the slave-state
men in the House and Senate. Besides this,
Garrett Davis of Kentucky made a very effective
argument when he said: &quot;There is not a rebel in
all Secessia whose heart will not leap when he
hears that the Senate of the United States is originating
such a policy. It will strengthen his
hopes of success by an ultimate union of all the
slave States to fight such a policy to the death.&quot;
It was, however, entirely evident that, in the present
temper of that part of the country which was
represented in Congress, there was not much use
in opposing any anti-slavery measure by any kind
of argument whatever; even though the special
proposition might be distasteful to many Republicans,
yet at last, when pressed to the issue, they
all faithfully voted Yea. In this case the measure,
<!-- Image No 27 --><a name='Png27'></a><a name='Page017'></a><span class="pagenum">017</span>finally so far modified as to relate only to slaves
of rebel owners, was passed and was signed by the
President on July 17. Nevertheless, although it
thus became law, the certainty that, by taking
action under it, he would alienate great numbers
of loyalists in the Border States induced him to
go very slowly. At first actual authority to enlist
negroes was only extorted from the administration
with much effort. On August 25 obstinate
importunity elicited an order permitting General
Saxton, at Hilton Head, to raise 5,000 black
troops; but this was somewhat strangely accompanied,
according to Mr. Wilson, with the suggestive
remark, that it &quot;must never see daylight,
because it was so much in advance of public sentiment.&quot;
After the process had been on trial for
a year, however, Mr. Lincoln said that there was
apparent &quot;no loss by it in our foreign relations,
none in our home popular sentiment, none in our
white military force,&mdash;no loss by it anyhow or
anywhere.&quot; On the other hand, it had brought
a reinforcement of 130,000 soldiers, seamen, and
laborers. &quot;And now,&quot; he said, &quot;let any Union
man who complains of this measure test himself
by writing down in one line that he is for subduing
the rebellion by force of arms, and in the next
that he is for taking these 130,000 men from the
Union side, and placing them where they would
be best for the measure he condemns.&quot; Yet so
ineradicable was the race prejudice that it was
not until the spring of 1864, after all efforts for
<!-- Image No 28 --><a name='Png28'></a><a name='Page018'></a><span class="pagenum">018</span>action by Congress had failed, that the attorney-general
declared black soldiers to be entitled to the
same pay as white soldiers. Regarding a soldier
merely as a marketable commodity, doubtless the
white was worth more money; yet life was about
the same to each, and it was hard to see why one
should be expected to sell his life for fewer dollars
than satisfied the other.</p>

<p>Besides these measures, Congress gave evidence
of its sentiments by passing an act for appointing
diplomatic representatives to Hayti and Liberia;
also further evidence by passing certain legislation
against the slave trade.</p>

<p>The recital of all these doings of the legislators
sufficiently indicates the hostility of Congress
towards slavery. In fact, a large majority both
in the Senate and in the House had moved out
against it upon nearly every practicable line to the
extremity of the constitutional tether. Neither
arguments, nor the entreaties of the border-state
men, nor any considerations of policy, had exercised
the slightest restraining influence. It is observable
that this legislation did not embody that
policy which Mr. Lincoln had suggested, and to
which he had become strongly attached. On the
contrary, Congress had done everything to irritate,
where the President wished to do everything to
conciliate; Congress made that compulsory which
the President hoped to make voluntary. Mr.
Lincoln remained in 1862, as he had been in 1858,
tolerant towards the Southern men who by inheritance,
<!-- Image No 29 --><a name='Png29'></a><a name='Page019'></a><span class="pagenum">019</span>
tradition, and the necessity of the situation,
constituted a slaveholding community. To treat
slave-ownership as a crime, punishable by confiscation
and ruin, seemed to him unreasonable and
merciless. Neither does he seem ever to have accepted
the opinion of many Abolitionists, that the
negro was the equal of the white man in natural
endowment. There is no reason to suppose that
he did not still hold, as he had done in the days
of the Douglas debates, that it was undesirable, if
not impossible, that the two races should endeavor
to abide together in freedom as a unified community.
In the inevitable hostility and competition
he clearly saw that the black man was likely to
fare badly. It was by such feelings that he was
led straight to the plan of compensation of owners
and colonization of freedmen, and to the hope
that a system of gradual emancipation, embodying
these principles, might be voluntarily undertaken
by the Border States under the present stress.
If the executive and the legislative departments
should combine upon the policy of encouraging
and aiding such steps as any Border State could
be induced to take in this direction, the President
believed that he could much more easily extend
loyalty and allegiance among the people of those
States,&mdash;a matter which he valued far more highly
than other persons were inclined to do. Such were
his views and such his wishes. To discuss their
practicability and soundness would only be to
wander in the unprofitable vagueness of hypothesis,
<!-- Image No 30 --><a name='Png30'></a><a name='Page020'></a><span class="pagenum">020</span>for in spite of all his efforts they were never tested
by trial. It must be admitted that general opinion,
both at that day and ever since, has regarded
them as visionary; compensation seemed too costly,
colonization probably was really impossible.</p>

<p>After the President had suggested his views in
his message he waited patiently to see what action
Congress would take concerning them. Three
months elapsed and Congress took no such action.
On the contrary, Congress practically repudiated
them. Not only this, it was industriously putting
into the shape of laws many other ideas, which
were likely to prove so many embarrassments and
obstructions to that policy which the President
had very thoughtfully and with deep conviction
marked out for himself. He determined, therefore,
to present it once more, before it should be rendered
forever hopeless. On March 6, 1862, he sent
to Congress a special message, recommending the
adoption of a joint resolution: &quot;That the United
States ought to cooperate with any State which
may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving
to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such
State in its discretion, to compensate for the inconvenience,
both public and private, produced by
such change of system.&quot; The first paragraph in
the message stated briefly the inducements to the
North: &quot;The Federal government would find its
highest interest in such a measure, as one of the
most efficient means of self-preservation. The
leaders of the existing insurrection entertain the
<!-- Image No 31 --><a name='Png31'></a><a name='Page021'></a><span class="pagenum">021</span>hope that this government will ultimately be forced
to acknowledge the independence of some part of
the disaffected region, and that all the slave States
north of such part will then say: 'The Union for
which we have struggled being already gone, we
now choose to go with the Southern section.' To
deprive them of this hope substantially ends the
rebellion; and the initiation of Emancipation completely
deprives them of it as to all the States
initiating it. The point is that ... the more
northern [States] shall, by such initiation, make it
certain to the more southern that in no event will
the former ever join the latter in their proposed
Confederacy. I say 'initiation,' because in my
judgment gradual and not sudden emancipation is
better for all. In the mere financial or pecuniary
view, any member of Congress, with the census
tables and Treasury reports before him, can readily
see for himself how very soon the current expenditures
of this war would purchase, at fair valuation,
all the slaves in any named State.&quot;</p>

<p>The second paragraph hinted at that which it
would have been poor tact to state plainly,&mdash;the
reasons which would press the Border States to
accept the opportunity extended to them. &quot;If
resistance continues, the war must also continue;
and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents
which may attend, and all the ruin which may follow
it. Such as may seem indispensable, or may
obviously promise great efficiency toward ending
the struggle, must and will come. The proposition
<!-- Image No 32 --><a name='Png32'></a><a name='Page022'></a><span class="pagenum">022</span>now made, though an offer only, I hope it may be
esteemed no offense to ask whether the pecuniary
consideration tendered would not be of more value
to the States and private persons concerned than
are the institution and property in it, in the present
aspect of affairs.&quot; The suggestion, between
the lines, to the border slave-owners could not be
misunderstood: that they would do better to sell
their slaves now than to be deprived of them later.
The President's proposition was not cordially
received. Pro-slavery men regarded it as an underhand
movement against the institution. Mr.
Crittenden expressed confidence in the President
personally, but feared that the resolution &quot;would
stir up an emancipation party&quot; in the loyal slave
States. Thus the truth was made plain that emancipation,
by any process, was not desired. In a
debate upon a cognate measure, another Kentuckian
said that there was &quot;no division of sentiment
on this question of emancipation, whether it is to be
brought about by force, by fraud, or by purchase
of slaves out of the public treasury.&quot; Democrats
from Northern States, natural allies of the border-state
men, protested vehemently against taxing
their constituents to buy slave property in other
States. Many Republicans also joined the Democracy
against Mr. Lincoln, and spoke even with
anger and insult. Thaddeus Stevens, the fierce
and formidable leader of the Radicals, gave his
voice against &quot;the most diluted milk-and-water
gruel proposition that had ever been given to the
<!-- Image No 33 --><a name='Png33'></a><a name='Page023'></a><span class="pagenum">023</span>American nation.&quot; Hickman of Pennsylvania,
until 1860 a Democrat, but now a Republican,
with the characteristic vehemence of a proselyte
said: &quot;Neither the message nor the resolution is
manly and open. They are both covert and insidious.
They do not become the dignity of the
President of the United States. The message is
not such a document as a full-grown, independent
man should publish to the nation at such a time
as the present, when positions should be freely
and fully defined.&quot; In the Senate, Mr. Powell of
Kentucky translated the second paragraph into
blunt words. He said that it held a threat of ultimate
coercion, if the cooperative plan should fail;
and he regarded &quot;the whole thing&quot; as &quot;a pill of
arsenic, sugar-coated.&quot;</p>

<p>But, though so many insisted upon uttering their
fleers in debate, yet, when it came to voting, they
could not well discredit their President by voting
down the resolution on the sole ground that it was
foolish and ineffectual. So, after it had been
abused sufficiently, it was passed by about the usual
party majority: 89 to 34 in the House; 32 to 10
in the Senate. Thus Congress somewhat sneeringly
handed back to the President his bantling,
with free leave to do what he could with it.</p>

<p>Not discouraged by such grudging and unsympathetic
permission, Mr. Lincoln at once set about
his experiment. He told Lovejoy and Arnold,
strenuous Abolitionists, but none the less his near
friends, that they would live to see the end of
<!-- Image No 34 --><a name='Png34'></a><a name='Page024'></a><span class="pagenum">024</span>slavery, if only the Border States would cooperate
in his project. On March 10, 1862, he gathered
some of the border-state members and tried to win
them over to his views. They listened coldly; but
he was not dismayed by their demeanor, and on
July 12 he again convened them, and this time
laid before them a written statement. This paper
betrays by its earnestness of argument and its
almost beseeching tone that he wrote it from his
heart. The reasons which he urged were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Believing that you of the Border States hold
more power for good than any other equal number
of members, I felt it a duty which I cannot justifiably
waive to make this appeal to you.</p>

<p>&quot;I intend no reproach or complaint when I
assure you that, in my opinion, if you all had
voted for the resolution in the gradual emancipation
message of last March, the war would now be
substantially ended.</p>

<p>&quot;And the plan therein proposed is yet one of
the most potent and swift means of ending it.
Let the States which are in rebellion see definitely
and certainly that in no event will the States you
represent ever join their proposed Confederacy,
and they cannot much longer maintain the contest.
But you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately
have you with them as long as you show a
determination to perpetuate the institution within
your own States; beat them at election as you have
overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they
<!-- Image No 35 --><a name='Png35'></a><a name='Page025'></a><span class="pagenum">025</span>still claim you as their own. You and I know
what the lever of their power is. Break that lever
before their faces, and they can shake you no more
forever. Most of you have treated me with kindness
and consideration; and I trust you will not
now think I improperly touch what is exclusively
your own, when, for the sake of the whole country,
I ask: can you, for your States, do better than to
take the course I urge? Discarding punctilio and
maxims adapted to more manageable times, and
looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of
our case, can you do better in any possible event?
You prefer that the constitutional relation of the
States to the nation shall be practically restored
without disturbance of the institution; and if this
were done, my whole duty in this respect under
the Constitution and my oath of office would be
performed. But it is not done, and we are trying
to accomplish it by war.</p>

<p>&quot;The incidents of the war cannot be avoided.
If the war continues long, as it must if the object
be not sooner attained, the institution in your
States will be extinguished by mere friction and
abrasion,&mdash;by the mere incidents of the war. It
will be gone, and you will have nothing valuable
in lieu of it. Much of its value is gone already.
How much better for you and your people to take
the step which at once shortens the war, and
secures substantial compensation for that which
is sure to be wholly lost in any other event. How
much better to thus save the money which else we
<!-- Image No 36 --><a name='Png36'></a><a name='Page026'></a><span class="pagenum">026</span>sink forever in the war. How much better to do
it while we can, lest the war erelong render us
pecuniarily unable to do it. How much better
for you, as seller, and the nation, as buyer, to
sell out and buy out that without which the war
never could have been, than to sink both the thing
to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another's
throats. I do not speak of emancipation
at once, but of a decision at once to emancipate
gradually.&quot;</p>

<p>He closed with an ardent appeal to his hearers,
as &quot;patriots and statesmen,&quot; to consider his proposition,
invoking them thereto as they &quot;would
perpetuate popular government for the best people
in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Thirty gentlemen listened to this paper and took
two days to consider it. Then twenty of them
signed a response which was, in substance, their
repudiation of the President's scheme. They told
him that hitherto they had been loyal &quot;under the
most discouraging circumstances and in face of
measures most distasteful to them and injurious to
the interests they represented, and in the hearing
of doctrines, avowed by those who claimed to be
his friends, most abhorrent to themselves and their
constituents.&quot; They objected that the measure
involved &quot;interference with what exclusively belonged
to the States;&quot; that perhaps it was unconstitutional;
that it would involve an &quot;immense
outlay,&quot; beyond what the finances could bear; that
it was &quot;the annunciation of a sentiment&quot; rather
<!-- Image No 37 --><a name='Png37'></a><a name='Page027'></a><span class="pagenum">027</span>than a &quot;tangible proposition;&quot; they added that the
sole purpose of the war must be &quot;restoring the
Constitution to its legitimate authority.&quot; Seven
others of the President's auditors said politely, but
very vaguely, that they would &quot;ask the people of
the Border States calmly, deliberately, and fairly
to consider his recommendations.&quot; Maynard, of
the House, and Henderson, of the Senate, alone
expressed their personal approval.</p>

<p>Even this did not drive all hope out of Mr.
Lincoln's heart. His proclamation, rescinding
that order of General Hunter which purported to
free slaves in certain States, was issued on May
19. In it he said that the resolution, which had
been passed at his request, &quot;now stands an authentic,
definite, and solemn proposal of the nation
to the States and people most interested in the
subject-matter. To the people of these States I
now earnestly appeal. I do not argue; I beseech
you to make the arguments for yourselves. You
cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs of the
times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration
of them, ranging, if it may be, far above
personal and partisan politics. This proposal
makes common cause for a common object, casting
no reproaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee.
The change it contemplates would come gently as
the dews from Heaven, not rending or wrecking
anything. Will you not embrace it? So much
good has not been done by one effort in all past
time as in the providence of God it is now your
<!-- Image No 38 --><a name='Png38'></a><a name='Page028'></a><span class="pagenum">028</span>high privilege to do. May the vast future not
have to lament that you have neglected it!&quot;</p>

<p>This eloquent and beautiful appeal sounds deeply
moving in the ears of those who read it in these
days, so remote from the passions and prejudices
of a generation ago; but it stirred little responsive
feeling and no responsive action in 1862. In fact,
the scheme was not practicable.</p>

<p>It may be&mdash;it probably must be&mdash;believed that
compensated emancipation and colonization could
never have been carried out even if Northern
Republicans had been willing to pay the price and
Southern slave-owners had been willing to accept
it, and if both had then cordially united in the task
of deporting the troublesome negro from the country.
The vast project was undoubtedly visionary;
it was to be criticised, weighed, and considered
largely as a business enterprise, and as such it
must be condemned. But Mr. Lincoln, who had
no capacity for business, was never able to get at
this point of view, and regarded his favorite plan
strictly in political and humanitarian lights. Yet
even thus the general opinion has been that the
unfortunate negroes, finding themselves amid the
hard facts which must inevitably have attended
colonization, would have heartily regretted the lost
condition of servitude. Historically the merits of
the experiment, which the Southern Unionists declined
to have put to the test of trial, are of no
consequence; it is only as the scheme throws light
upon the magnanimity of Mr. Lincoln's temperament
<!-- Image No 39 --><a name='Png39'></a><a name='Page029'></a><span class="pagenum">029</span>
and upon certain limitations of his intellect,
that the subject is interesting. That he should
rid himself of personal vindictiveness and should
cherish an honest and intense desire to see the
question, which had severed the country, disposed
of by a process which would make possible a sincere
and cordial reunion, may be only moderately
surprising; but it is most surprising to note the
depth and earnestness of his faith that this condition
could really be reached, and that it could
be reached by the road which he had marked out.
This confidence indicated an opinion of human
nature much higher than human nature has yet
appeared entitled to. It also anticipated on the
part of the Southerners an appreciation of the
facts of the case which few among them were sufficiently
clear-minded to furnish. It is curious to
observe that Lincoln saw the present situation and
foresaw the coming situation with perfect clearness,
at the same time that he was entirely unable to
see the uselessness of his panacea; whereas, on the
other hand, those who rejected his impracticable
plan remained entirely blind to those things which
he saw. It seems an odd combination of traits
that he always recognized and accepted a fact, and
yet was capable of being wholly impractical.</p>

<p>In connection with these efforts in behalf of the
slaveholders, which show at least a singular goodness
of heart towards persons who had done everything
to excite even a sense of personal hatred, it
may not be seriously out of place to quote a paragraph
<!-- Image No 40 --><a name='Png40'></a><a name='Page030'></a><span class="pagenum">030</span>
which does not, indeed, bear upon slavery,
but which does illustrate the remarkable temper
which Mr. Lincoln maintained towards the seceding
communities. In December, 1861, in his
annual message to this Congress, whose searching
anti-slavery measures have just been discussed, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;There are three vacancies on the bench of the
Supreme Court.... I have so far forborne
making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons
which I will now state. Two of the outgoing
judges resided within the States now overrun by
revolt; so that if successors were appointed in the
same localities, they could not now serve upon
their circuits; and many of the most competent
men there probably would not take the personal
hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the
Supreme Bench. I have been unwilling to throw
all the appointments northward, thus disabling
myself from doing justice to the South on the return
of peace; although I may remark that to
transfer to the North one which has heretofore
been in the South would not, with reference to
territory and population, be unjust.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_3_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_3'><sup>[3]</sup></a> To comment
upon behavior and motives so extraordinary
is, perhaps, as needless as it is tempting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2>THE SECOND ACT OF THE MCCLELLAN DRAMA</h2>

<p>It is time now to return to the theatre of war
in Virginia, where, it will be remembered, we left
the Confederate forces in the act of rapidly withdrawing
southward from the line of intrenchments
which they had so long held at Manassas. This
unexpected backward movement upon their part
deprived the Urbana route, which McClellan had
hitherto so strenuously advocated, of its chief
strategic advantages, and therefore reopened the
old question which had been discussed between
him and Mr. Lincoln. To the civilian mind a
movement after the retreating enemy along the
direct line to Richmond, now more than ever before,
seemed the natural scheme. But to this
McClellan still remained unalterably opposed. In
the letter of February 3 he had said: &quot;The worst
coming to the worst, we can take Fort Monroe
as a base and operate with complete security, although
with less celerity and brilliancy of results,
up the Peninsula.&quot; This route, low as he had
then placed it in order of desirability, he now
adopted as the best resource, or rather as the
only measure; and his judgment was ratified upon
<!-- Image No 42 --><a name='Png42'></a><a name='Page032'></a><span class="pagenum">032</span>March 13 by unanimous approval on the part of
his four corps commanders. They however made
their approval dependent upon conditions, among
which were: that, before beginning the advance
along this line, the new rebel ram Merrimac (or
Virginia), just finished at Norfolk on the James
River, should be neutralized, and that a naval
auxiliary force should silence, or be ready to aid in
silencing, the rebel batteries on the York River.
In fact, and very unfortunately, the former of
these conditions was not fulfilled until the time of
its usefulness for this specific purpose was over,
and the latter condition was entirely neglected. It
was also distinctly stipulated that &quot;the force to be
left to cover Washington shall be such as to give
an entire feeling of security for its safety from
menace.&quot; Keyes, Heintzelman and McDowell conceived
&quot;that, with the forts on the right bank of
the Potomac fully garrisoned, and those on the
left bank occupied, a covering force, in front of
the Virginia line, of 25,000 men would suffice.&quot;
Sumner said: &quot;A total of 40,000 for the defense
of the city would suffice.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_4_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_4'><sup>[4]</sup></a> On the same day
Stanton informed McClellan that the President
&quot;made no objection&quot; to this plan, but directed that
a sufficient force should be left to hold Manassas
Junction and to make Washington &quot;entirely secure.&quot;
<!-- Image No 43 --><a name='Png43'></a><a name='Page033'></a><span class="pagenum">033</span>
The closing sentence was: &quot;At all events,
move ... at once in pursuit of the enemy by
some route.&quot; Thus at last two important facts
were established: that the route up the Peninsula
should be tried; and that the patience of the administration
was exhausted.</p>

<p>Though the enemy upon his retreat was burning
bridges and destroying railroads behind him, and
making his possible return towards Washington a
slow, difficult process, which he obviously had no
mind to undertake, still this security of the capital
rested as weightily as ever upon Lincoln's
mind. His reiteration and insistence concerning
it made perfectly plain that he was still nervous
and disquieted about it, though now certainly with
much less reason than heretofore. But with or
against reason, it was easy to see that he was far
from resting in the tranquillity of conviction that
Washington could never be so safe as when the
army of Virginia was far away upon the Peninsula.
Nevertheless, after the condition in its foregoing
shape had been so strenuously imposed by
Mr. Lincoln and tacitly accepted by McClellan,
the matter was left as if definitely settled; and the
President never demanded<a name='FNanchor_5_5'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_5'><sup>[5]</sup></a> from the general any
distinct statement concerning the numerical or
<!-- Image No 44 --><a name='Png44'></a><a name='Page034'></a><span class="pagenum">034</span>specific allotment of the available forces between
the two purposes. The neglect was disastrous in
its consequences; and must also be pronounced
both blameworthy and inexplicable, for the necessity
of a plain understanding on the subject was
obvious.</p>

<p>The facts seem to be briefly these: in his letter
of February 3, McClellan estimated the force
necessary to be taken with him for his campaign
at 110,000 to 140,000 men, and said: &quot;I hope to
use the latter number by bringing fresh troops
into Washington.&quot; On April 1 he reported<a name='FNanchor_6_6'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_6'><sup>[6]</sup></a> the
forces left behind him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>He adds: &quot;There will thus be left for the garrisons,
and the front of Washington, under General
Wadsworth, 18,000 men, exclusive of the batteries
under instruction.&quot; New levies, nearly 4,000
strong, were also expected. He considered all
these men as properly available &quot;for the defense
of the national capital and its approaches.&quot; The
<!-- Image No 45 --><a name='Png45'></a><a name='Page035'></a><span class="pagenum">035</span>President, the politicians, and some military men
were of opinion that only the 18,000 ought to be
considered available for the capital. It was a
question whether it was proper to count the corps
of Banks in the Shenandoah Valley. McClellan's
theory was that the rebels, by the circumstances
attendant upon their present retreating movement,
had conclusively annulled any chance of their own
return by way of Manassas. Banks greatly outnumbered
Stonewall Jackson, who had only about
15,000 men, or less, in the Shenandoah Valley.
Also Washington was now entirely surrounded by
satisfactory fortifications. McClellan, therefore,
was entirely confident that he left everything in
good shape behind him. In fact, it was put into
even better shape than he had designed; for on
March 31 the President took from him Blenker's
division of 10,000 men in order to strengthen Fremont,
who was in the mountain region westward
of the Shenandoah Valley. &quot;I did so,&quot; wrote Mr.
Lincoln, &quot;with great pain.... If you could
know the full pressure of the case, I am confident
that you would justify it.&quot; It was unfortunate
that the President could not stand against this
&quot;pressure,&quot; which was not military, but political.
Fremont could do, and did, nothing at all, and to
reinforce him was sheer absurdity.<a name='FNanchor_7_7'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_7'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Against it
McClellan protested almost indignantly, but was
&quot;partially relieved by the President's positive and
emphatic assurance&quot; that no more troops &quot;should
<!-- Image No 46 --><a name='Png46'></a><a name='Page036'></a><span class="pagenum">036</span>in any event be taken from&quot; him, or &quot;in any way
detached from [his] command.&quot;</p>

<p>Orders had been issued on February 27, to Mr.
Tucker, assistant secretary of war, to prepare
means of transporting down the Potomac, troops,
munitions, artillery, horses, wagons, food, and all
the vast paraphernalia of a large army. He
showed a masterly vigor in this difficult task, and
by March 17 the embarkation began. On April 2
McClellan arrived at Fortress Monroe. On the
very next day he was disturbed by the revocation
of the orders which had left him in command of
that place and had allowed him to &quot;draw from the
troops under General Wool a division of about
10,000 men, which was to be assigned to the First
Corps.&quot; Another and a serious disappointment
also occurred at once; he found that the navy
could not be utilized for assisting in an attack on
Yorktown, or for running by it so as to land forces
in rear of it. He must therefore depend wholly
upon his army to force a way up the Peninsula.
This he had stated to be an unsatisfactory alternative,
because it involved delay at Yorktown. Nevertheless,
having no choice, he began his advance on
April 4. He had with him only 58,000 men; but
more were on the way, and McDowell's corps was
to be brought forward to join him as rapidly as
transportation would permit. His total nominal
force was smaller than the minimum which, on
February 3, he had named as necessary; yet it was
a fine body of troops, and he had lately said to
<!-- Image No 47 --><a name='Png47'></a><a name='Page037'></a><span class="pagenum">037</span>them: &quot;The army of the Potomac is now a real
army, magnificent in material, admirable in discipline,
excellently equipped and armed. Your
commanders are all that I could wish.&quot;</p>

<p>In two days he was before the fortifications
which the rebels had erected at Yorktown, and
which stretched thence across the Peninsula to the
James River. He estimated the force behind these
intrenchments, commanded by General Magruder,
at 15,000 to 20,000 men, easily to be reinforced;
in fact, it was much less. Thereupon, he set about
elaborate preparations for a siege of that city, according
to the most thorough and approved system
of military science. He was afterward severely
blamed for not endeavoring to force his way
through some point in the rebel lines by a series
of assaults.<a name='FNanchor_8_8'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_8'><sup>[8]</sup></a> This was what Mr. Lincoln wished
him to do, and very nearly ordered him to do;
for on April 6 he sent this telegram: &quot;You now
have over 100,000 troops with you.... I think
you better break the enemy's line from Yorktown
to Warwick River at once.&quot; An entry in McClellan's
&quot;Own Story,&quot; under date of April 8,
comments upon this message and illustrates the
unfortunate feeling of the writer towards his
official superior: &quot;I have raised an awful row
about McDowell's corps. The President very
coolly telegraphed me yesterday that he thought I
had better break the enemy's lines at once! I was
much tempted to reply that he had better come
<!-- Image No 48 --><a name='Png48'></a><a name='Page038'></a><span class="pagenum">038</span>and do it himself.&quot; Thus is made evident the
lamentable relationship between the President,
who could place no confidence in the enterprise
and judgment of the military commander, and the
general, who had only sneers for the President's
incapacity to comprehend warfare. It so happened,
however, that the professional man's sarcasm was
grossly out of place, and the civilian's proposal
was shrewdly right, as events soon plainly proved.
In fact what Mr. Lincoln urged was precisely what
General Johnston anticipated and feared would
be done, because he knew well that if it were
done it would be of fatal effect against the Confederates.
But, on the other hand, even after the
clear proof had gone against him, McClellan was
abundantly supplied with excuses, and the vexation
of the whole affair was made the greater by the
fact that these excuses really seemed to be good.
His excuses always were both so numerous and so
satisfactory, that many reasonably minded persons
knew not whether they had a right to feel so angry
towards him as they certainly could not help doing.
The present instance was directly in point. General
Keyes reported to him that no part of the
enemy's line could &quot;be taken by assault without
an enormous waste of life;&quot; and General Barnard,
chief engineer of the army, thought it uncertain
whether they could be carried at all. Loss of
life and uncertainty of result were two things so
abhorred by McClellan in warfare, that he now
failed to give due weight to the consideration that
<!-- Image No 49 --><a name='Png49'></a><a name='Page039'></a><span class="pagenum">039</span>the design of the Confederates in interposing an
obstacle at this point was solely to delay him as
much as possible, whereas much of the merit of
his own plan of campaign lay in rapid execution
at the outset. The result was, of course, that he
did not break any line, nor try to, but instead
thereof &quot;presented plausible reasons&quot; out of his
inexhaustible reservoir of such commodities. It
was unfortunate that the naval co&ouml;peration, which
McClellan had expected,<a name='FNanchor_9_9'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_9'><sup>[9]</sup></a> could not be had at this
juncture; for by it the Yorktown problem would
have been easily solved without either line-breaking
or reason-giving.</p>

<p>Precisely at this point came into operation the
fatal effect of the lack of understanding between
the President and the general as to the division of
the forces. In the plan of campaign, it had been
designed to throw the corps of McDowell into the
rear of Yorktown by such route as should seem
expedient at the time of its arrival, probably landing
it at Gloucester and moving it round by West
Point. This would have made Magruder's position
untenable at once, long before the natural end
of the siege. But at the very moment when McClellan's
left, in its advance, first came into actual
collision with the enemy, he received news that
the President had ordered McDowell to retain his
division before Washington&mdash;&quot;the most infamous
thing that history has recorded,&quot; he afterward
<!-- Image No 50 --><a name='Png50'></a><a name='Page040'></a><span class="pagenum">040</span>wrote.<a name='FNanchor_10_10'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_10'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Yet the explanation of this surprising
news was so simple that surprise was unjustifiable.
On April 2, immediately after McClellan's
departure, the President inquired as to what had
been done for the security of Washington. General
Wadsworth, commanding the defenses of the
city, gave an alarming response: 19,000 or 20,000
entirely green troops, and a woeful insufficiency
of artillery. He said that while it was &quot;very improbable&quot;
that the enemy would attack Washington,
nevertheless the &quot;numerical strength and the
character&quot; of his forces rendered them &quot;entirely
inadequate to and unfit for their important duty.&quot;
Generals Hitchcock and Thomas corroborated this
by reporting that the order to leave the city &quot;entirely
secure&quot; had &quot;not been fully complied with.&quot;
Mr. Lincoln was horror-struck. He had a right
to be indignant, for those who ought to know assured
him that his reiterated and most emphatic
command had been disobeyed, and that what he
chiefly cared to make safe had not been made safe.
He promptly determined to retain McDowell, and
the order was issued on April 4. Thereby he seriously
attenuated, if he did not quite annihilate,
<!-- Image No 51 --><a name='Png51'></a><a name='Page041'></a><span class="pagenum">041</span>the prospect of success for McClellan's campaign.
It seems incredible and unexplainable that amid
this condition of things, on April 3, an order was
issued from the office of the secretary of war, to
stop recruiting throughout the country!</p>

<p>This series of diminutions, says McClellan, had
&quot;removed nearly 60,000 men from my command,
and reduced my force by more than one third....
The blow was most discouraging. It frustrated
all my plans for impending operations. It
fell when I was too deeply committed to withdraw....
It was a fatal error.&quot;</p>

<p>Error or not, it was precisely what McClellan
ought to have foreseen as likely to occur. He had
not foreseen it, however, and nothing mitigated
the disappointment. Unquestionably the act was
of supreme gravity. Was Mr. Lincoln right or
wrong in doing it? The question has been answered
many times both Yea and Nay, and each
side has been maintained with intense acrimony
and perfect good faith. It is not likely that it will
ever be possible to say either that the Yeas have
it, or that the Nays have it.<a name='FNanchor_11_11'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_11'><sup>[11]</sup></a> For while it is certain
<!-- Image No 52 --><a name='Png52'></a><a name='Page042'></a><span class="pagenum">042</span>
that what actually <i>did</i> happen coincided very
accurately with McClellan's expectations; on the
other hand, it can never be known what <i>might have</i>
happened if Lincoln had not held McDowell, and
if, therefore, facts had not been what they were.</p>

<p>So far as Mr. Lincoln is concerned, the question,
what military judgment was correct,&mdash;that
is, whether the capital really was, or was not,
absolutely secure,&mdash;is of secondary consequence.
The valuation which he set on that safety was
undeniably correct; it certainly was of more importance
than McClellan's success. If he had
made a mistake in letting McClellan go without
a more distinct understanding, at least that mistake
was behind him. Before him was the issue
whether he should rest satisfied with the deliberate
judgment given by McClellan, or whether, at considerable
cost to the cause, he should make the
assurance greater out of deference to other advice.
He chose the latter course. In so doing, if he
was not vacillating, he was at least incurring the
evils of vacillation. It would have been well if
he could have found some quarter in which permanently
to repose his implicit faith, so that one
consistent plan could have been carried out without
interference. Either he had placed too much
confidence in McClellan in the past, or he was
placing too little in him now. If he could not
accept McClellan's opinion as to the safety of
<!-- Image No 53 --><a name='Png53'></a><a name='Page043'></a><span class="pagenum">043</span>Washington, in preference to that of Wadsworth,
Thomas, and Hitchcock, then he should have removed
McClellan, and replaced him with some
one in whom he had sufficient confidence to make
smooth co&ouml;peration a possibility. The present
condition of things was illogical and dangerous.
Matters had been allowed to reach a very advanced
stage upon the theory that McClellan's judgment
was trustworthy; then suddenly the stress became
more severe, and it seemed that in the bottom
of his mind the President did not thus implicitly
respect the general's wisdom. Yet he did not
displace him, but only opened his ears to other
counsels; whereupon the buzz of contradictory,
excited, and alarming suggestions which came to
him were more than enough to unsettle any human
judgment. General Webb speaks well and with
authority to this matter: &quot;The dilemma lay here,&mdash;whose
plans and advice should he follow, where
it was necessary for him to approve and decide?...
Should he lean implicitly on the general
actually in command of the armies, placed there
by virtue of his presumed fitness for the position,
or upon other selected advisers? We are bold to
say that it was doubt and hesitation upon this
point that occasioned many of the blunders of the
campaign. Instead of one mind, there were many
minds influencing the management of military
affairs.&quot; A familiar culinary proverb was receiving
costly illustration.</p>

<p>But, setting the dispute aside, an important fact
<!-- Image No 54 --><a name='Png54'></a><a name='Page044'></a><span class="pagenum">044</span>remains: shorn as he was, McClellan was still
strong enough to meet and to defeat his opponents.
If he had been one of the great generals of the
world he would have been in Richmond before
May Day; but he was at his old trick of exaggerating
the hostile forces and the difficulties in his
way. On April 7 he thought that Johnston and
the whole Confederate army were at Yorktown;
whereas Johnston's advance division arrived there
on the 10th; the other divisions came several days
later, and Johnston himself arrived only on the
14th.</p>

<p>On April 9 Mr. Lincoln presented his own view
of the situation in this letter to the general:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Your dispatches complaining that you are not
properly sustained, while they do not offend me,
do pain me very much.</p>

<p>... &quot;After you left I ascertained that less than
20,000 unorganized men, without a single field
battery, were all you designed to be left for the
defense of Washington and Manassas Junction,
and part of this even was to go to General Hooker's
old position. General Banks's corps, once
designed for Manassas Junction, was diverted and
tied up on the line of Winchester and Strasburg,
and could not leave it without again exposing
the upper Potomac and the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad. This presented, or would present,
when McDowell and Sumner should be gone, a
great temptation to the enemy to turn back from
<!-- Image No 55 --><a name='Png55'></a><a name='Page045'></a><span class="pagenum">045</span>the Rappahannock and sack Washington. My
implicit order that Washington should, by the
judgment of all the commanders of army corps, be
left entirely secure, had been neglected. It was
precisely this that drove me to detain McDowell.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not forget that I was satisfied with your
arrangement to leave Banks at Manassas Junction;
but when that arrangement was broken up,
and nothing was substituted for it, of course I was
constrained to substitute something for it myself.
And allow me to ask, do you really think I should
permit the line from Richmond, via Manassas
Junction, to this city, to be entirely open, except
what resistance could be presented by less than
20,000 unorganized troops? This is a question
which the country will not allow me to evade.</p>

<p>&quot;There is a curious mystery about the number
of troops now with you. When I telegraphed you
on the 6th, saying you had over a hundred thousand
with you, I had just obtained from the secretary
of war a statement taken, as he said, from
your own returns, making 108,000 then with you
and en route to you. You now say you will have
but 85,000 when all en route to you shall have
reached you. How can the discrepancy of 23,000
be accounted for?</p>

<p>&quot;As to General Wool's command,<a name='FNanchor_12_12'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_12'><sup>[12]</sup></a> I understand
<!-- Image No 56 --><a name='Png56'></a><a name='Page046'></a><span class="pagenum">046</span>it is doing for you precisely what a like number
of your own would have to do if that command
was away.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose the whole force which has gone
forward for you is with you by this time. And if
so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike
a blow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain
upon you,&mdash;that is, he will gain faster by fortifications
and reinforcements than you can by reinforcements
alone. And once more let me tell you,
it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow.
I am powerless to help this. You will do me the
justice to remember I always insisted that going
down the bay in search of a field, instead of fighting
at or near Manassas, was only shifting, and
not surmounting, a difficulty; that we would find
the same enemy, and the same or equal intrenchments,
at either place. The country will not fail
to note, is now noting, that the present hesitation
to move upon an intrenched enemy is but the story
of Manassas repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg to assure you that I have never written
you or spoken to you in greater kindness of feeling
than now, nor with a fuller purpose to sustain you,
so far as, in my most anxious judgment, I consistently
can. But you must act.&quot;</p>

<p>McClellan, in consternation and almost despair
at the repeated pruning of his force, now begged
for at least a part of McDowell's corps, which,
he said on April 10, was &quot;indispensable;&quot; &quot;the
fate of our cause depends upon it.&quot; Accordingly
<!-- Image No 57 --><a name='Png57'></a><a name='Page047'></a><span class="pagenum">047</span>Franklin's division was sent to him; and then,
after all this palaver, he kept it a fortnight on
shipboard, until Yorktown was evacuated!</p>

<p>On May 1 the President, tortured by the political
gadflies in Washington, and suffering painfully
from the weariness of hope so long deferred, telegraphed:
&quot;Is anything to be done?&quot; A pitiful
time of it Mr. Lincoln was having, and it called
for a patient fortitude surpassing imagination.
Yet one little bit of fruit was at this moment
ripe for the plucking! After about four weeks
of wearisome labor the general had brought matters
to that condition which was so grateful to his
cautious soul. At the beginning of May he had
reduced success to a certainty, so that he expected
to open fire on May 5, and to make short work of
the rebel stronghold. But it so happened that
another soldier also had at the same time finished
his task. General Magruder had delayed
the Union army to the latest possible hour, he had
saved a whole valuable month; and now, quite
cheerfully and triumphantly, in the night betwixt
May 3 and May 4, he quietly slipped away. As
it had happened at Manassas, so now again the
Federals marched unopposed into deserted intrenchments;
and a second time the enemy had so
managed it that their retreat seemed rather to cast
a slur upon Union strategy than to bring prestige
to the Union arms.</p>

<p>McClellan at once continued his advance, with
more or less fighting, the rebels steadily drawing
<!-- Image No 58 --><a name='Png58'></a><a name='Page048'></a><span class="pagenum">048</span>back without offering battle on a large scale,
though there was a sharp engagement at Williamsburg.
He had not even the smaller number of
men which he had originally named as his requirement,
and he continued pertinaciously to demand
liberal reinforcements. The President, grievously
harassed by these importunate appeals, declared to
McClellan that he was forwarding every man that
he could, while to friends nearer at hand he complained
that sending troops to McClellan was like
shoveling fleas across a barnyard; most of them
didn't get there! At last he made up his mind
to send the remainder of McDowell's corps; not
because he had changed his mind about covering
Washington, but because the situation had become
such that he expected to arrange this matter by
other resources.</p>

<p>The fight at Williamsburg took place on May 5.
McClellan pushed after the retiring enemy, too
slowly, as his detractors said, yet by roads which
really were made almost impassable by heavy
rains. Two days later, May 7, Franklin's force
disembarked and occupied West Point. This advance
up the Peninsula now produced one important
result which had been predicted by McClellan
in his letter of February 3. On May 8 news came
that the Confederates were evacuating Norfolk,
and two days later a Union force marched into the
place. The rebels lost many heavy guns, besides
all the advantages of the navy yard with its workshops
and stores; moreover, their awe-inspiring
<!-- Image No 59 --><a name='Png59'></a><a name='Page049'></a><span class="pagenum">049</span>ram, the Merrimac, alias the Virginia, was obliged
to leave this comfortable nestling-place, whence
she had long watched and closed the entrance
to the James River. Her commander, Tatnall,
would have taken her up that stream, but the
pilots declared it not possible to float her over the
shoals. She was therefore abandoned and set on
fire; and early in the morning of May 11 she blew
up, leaving the southern water-way to Richmond
open to the Union fleet.<a name='FNanchor_13_13'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_13'><sup>[13]</sup></a> It was a point of immense
possible advantage. Later McClellan intimated
that, if he had been left free to act upon his
own judgment, he would probably have availed
himself of this route; and some writers, with predilections
in his favor, have assumed that he was
prevented from doing so by certain orders, soon to
be mentioned, which directed him to keep the
northerly route for the purpose of effecting a junction
with McDowell. But this notion seems incorrect;
for though he doubtless had the James River
route under consideration, yet dates are against
the theory that he wished to adopt it when at last
it lay open. On the contrary, he continued his
advance precisely as before. On May 16 his leading
columns reached White House; headquarters
were established there, and steps were immediately
taken to utilize it as a depot and base of supplies.
The York River route was thus made the definitive
choice. Also the advance divisions were immediately
<!-- Image No 60 --><a name='Png60'></a><a name='Page050'></a><span class="pagenum">050</span>
pushed out along the York River and Richmond
Railroad, which they repaired as they went.
On May 20 Casey's division actually crossed the
Chickahominy at Bottom's Bridge, and the next
day a large part of the army was in position upon
the north bank of that stream. Obviously these
operations, each and all, ruled out the James River
route, at least as a part of the present plan. Yet
it was not until they were well under way, viz., on
May 18, that the intelligence reached McClellan,
on the strength of which he and others afterward
assumed that he had been deprived of the power
to select the James River route. What this intelligence
was and how it came to pass must now
be narrated.</p>

<p>By this time, the advance along the Peninsula
had so completely &quot;relieved the front of Washington
from pressure,&quot; that Mr. Lincoln and his advisers,
reassured as to the safety of that city, now
saw their way clear to make McDowell's corps,
strengthened to a force of 41,000 men, contribute
actively to McClellan's assistance. They could
not, indeed, bring themselves to move it by water,
as McClellan desired; but the President ordered
McDowell to move down from Fredericksburg,
where he now lay, towards McClellan's right wing,
which McClellan was ordered to extend to the
north of Richmond in order to meet him. But,
in the words of the Comte de Paris, &quot;an absurd
restriction revealed the old mistrusts and fears.&quot;
For McDowell was strictly ordered not to uncover
<!-- Image No 61 --><a name='Png61'></a><a name='Page051'></a><span class="pagenum">051</span>the capital; also, with a decisive emphasis indicative
of an uneasy suspicion, McClellan was forbidden
to dispose of McDowell's force in contravention
of this still primary purpose. Whether McDowell
was under McClellan's control, or retained an
independent command, was left curiously vague,
until McClellan forced a distinct understanding.</p>

<p>Although McClellan, writing to Lincoln, condemned
rather sharply the method selected for
giving to him the aid so long implored, yet he felt
that, even as it came to him, he could make it
serve his turn. Though he grumbled at the President's
unmilitary ways, he afterward admitted
that the &quot;cheering news&quot; made him &quot;confident&quot;
of being &quot;sufficiently strong to overpower the large
army confronting&quot; him. There was no doubt of
it. He immediately extended his right wing; May
24, he drove the Confederates out of Mechanicsville;
May 26, General Porter took position at
Hanover Junction only fifteen miles from McDowell's
head of column, which had advanced eight
miles out of Fredericksburg. The situation was
not unpromising; but unfortunately that little interval
of fifteen miles was never to be closed up.</p>

<p>May 24, Mr. Lincoln wrote to McClellan, and
after suggesting sundry advisable movements, he
said: &quot;McDowell and Shields<a name='FNanchor_14_14'></a><a href='#Footnote_14_14'><sup>[14]</sup></a> both say they
can, and positively will, move Monday morning.&quot;
Monday was the 26th. In point of fact, McDowell,
feeling time to be of great value, urged the
<!-- Image No 62 --><a name='Png62'></a><a name='Page052'></a><span class="pagenum">052</span>President to let him move on the morning of Sunday,
the 25th; but Mr. Lincoln positively refused;
the battle of Bull Run had been fought on a
Sunday, and he dreaded the omen.<a name='FNanchor_15_15'></a><a href='#Footnote_15_15'><sup>[15]</sup></a> This feeling
which he had about days was often illustrated, and
probably the reader has observed that he seemed
to like dates already marked by prestige or good
luck; thus he had convened Congress for July 4,
and had ordered the general advance of the armies
for February 22; it was an indication of the curious
thread of superstition which ran through his
strange nature,&mdash;a remnant of his youth and the
mysterious influence of the wilderness. But worse
than a superstitious postponement arrived before
nightfall on Saturday. A dispatch from Lincoln
to McClellan, dated at four o'clock that afternoon,
said: &quot;In consequence of General Banks's
critical position, I have been compelled to suspend
General McDowell's movements to join you. The
enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper's
Ferry, and we are trying to throw General Fremont's
force and part of General McDowell's in
their rear.&quot; The brief words conveyed momentous
intelligence. It is necessary to admit that Mr.
Lincoln was making his one grand blunder, for
which there is not even the scant salvation of possible
doubt. All that can be said in palliation is,
<!-- Image No 63 --><a name='Png63'></a><a name='Page053'></a><span class="pagenum">053</span>that he was governed, or at least strongly impelled,
by the urgent advice of the secretary of war,
whose hasty telegrams to the governors of several
States show that he was terror-stricken and had
lost his head. Mr. Blaine truly says that McDowell,
thus suddenly dispatched by Mr. Lincoln
upon a &quot;fruitless chase,&quot; &quot;was doing precisely
what the President of the Confederate States would
have ordered, had he been able to issue the orders
of the President of the United States.&quot; There is
no way to mitigate the painful truth of this statement,
made by a civilian, but amply sustained by
the military authorities on both sides.<a name='FNanchor_16_16'></a><a href='#Footnote_16_16'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p>The condition was this. The retention of
McDowell's corps before Washington published
the anxiety of the administration. The Confederate
advantage lay in keeping that anxiety alive and
continuing to neutralize that large body of troops.
Strategists far less able than the Southern generals
could not have missed so obvious a point, neither
could they have missed the equally obvious means
at their disposal for achieving these purposes.
At the upper end of the valley of the Shenandoah
Stonewall Jackson had an army, raised by recent
accretions to nearly or quite 15,000 men. The
Northern generals erelong learned to prognosticate
Jackson's movements by the simple rule that at
the time when he was least expected, and at the
<!-- Image No 64 --><a name='Png64'></a><a name='Page054'></a><span class="pagenum">054</span>place where he was least wanted, he was sure to
turn up.<a name='FNanchor_17_17'></a><a href='#Footnote_17_17'><sup>[17]</sup></a> The suddenness and speed with which
he could move a body of troops seemed marvelous
to ordinary men. His business now was to make
a vigorous dashing foray down the valley. To the
westward, Fremont lay in the mountains, with an
army which checked no enemy and for the existence
of which in that place no reasonable explanation
could be given. In front was Banks, with a
force lately reduced to about 5,000 men. May 14,
Banks prudently fell back and took position in
Strasburg.<a name='FNanchor_18_18'></a><a href='#Footnote_18_18'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Suddenly, on May 23, Jackson appeared
at Front Royal; on the next day he attacked
Banks at Winchester, and of course defeated him;
on the 25th Banks made a rapid retreat to the Potomac,
and Jackson made an equally rapid pursuit
to Halltown, within two miles of Harper's Ferry.
The news of this startling foray threw the civilians
of Washington into a genuine panic, by which
Mr. Lincoln was, at least for a few hours, not
altogether unaffected.<a name='FNanchor_19_19'></a><a href='#Footnote_19_19'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Yet, though startled and
<!-- Image No 65 --><a name='Png65'></a><a name='Page055'></a><span class="pagenum">055</span>alarmed, he showed the excellent quality of promptitude
in decision and action; and truly it was hard
fortune that his decision and his action were both
for the worst. He at once ordered McDowell to
move 20,000 troops into the Shenandoah Valley,
and instructed Fremont also to move his force
rapidly into the valley, with the design that the
two should thus catch Jackson in what Mr. Lincoln
described as a &quot;trap.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_20_20'></a><a href='#Footnote_20_20'><sup>[20]</sup></a> McDowell was dismayed
at such an order. He saw, what every man
having any military knowledge at once recognized
with entire certainty, and what every military
writer has since corroborated, that the movement of
Jackson had no value except as a diversion, that it
threatened no serious danger, and that to call off
McDowell's corps from marching to join McClellan
in order to send it against Jackson was to do
exactly that thing which the Confederates desired
to have done, though they could hardly have been
sanguine enough to expect it. It was swallowing
a bait so plain that it might almost be said to be
labeled. For a general to come under the suspicion
of not seeing through such a ruse was humiliating.
In vain McDowell explained, protested,
and entreated with the utmost vehemence and insistence.
When Mr. Lincoln had made up his
mind, no man could change it, and here, as ill
<!-- Image No 66 --><a name='Png66'></a><a name='Page056'></a><span class="pagenum">056</span>fortune would have it, he had made it up. So,
with a heavy heart, the reluctant McDowell set
forth on his foolish errand, and Fremont likewise
came upon his,&mdash;though it is true that he was
better employed thus than in doing nothing,&mdash;and
Jackson, highly pleased, and calculating his
time to a nicety, on May 31 slipped rapidly between
the two Union generals,&mdash;the closing jaws
of Mr. Lincoln's &quot;trap,&quot;&mdash;and left them to close
upon nothing.<a name='FNanchor_21_21'></a><a href='#Footnote_21_21'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Then he led his pursuers a fruitless
chase towards the head of the valley, continuing
to neutralize a force many times larger than
his own, and which could and ought to have been
at this very time doing fatal work against the Confederacy.
Presumably he had saved Richmond,
and therewith also, not impossibly, the chief army
of the South. The chagrin of the Union commanders,
who had in vain explained the situation
with entire accuracy, taxes the imagination.</p>

<p>There is no use in denying a truth which can be
proved. The blunder of Mr. Lincoln is not only
undeniable, but it is inexcusable. Possibly for a
few hours he feared that Washington was threatened.
He telegraphed to McClellan May 25, at
two o'clock P.M., that he thought the movement
down the valley a &quot;general and concerted one,&quot;
inconsistent with &quot;the purpose of a very desperate
defense of Richmond;&quot; and added, &quot;I think the
time is near when you must either attack Richmond,
<!-- Image No 67 --><a name='Png67'></a><a name='Page057'></a><span class="pagenum">057</span>
or give up the job and come to the defense
of Washington.&quot; How reasonable this view was
at the moment is of little consequence, for within
a few hours afterward the character of Jackson's
enterprise as a mere foray became too palpable to
be mistaken. Nevertheless, after the President
was relieved from such fear for the capital as he
might excusably have felt for a very brief period,
his cool judgment seemed for once in his life, perhaps
for the only time, to be disturbed. The truth
is that Mr. Lincoln was a sure and safe, almost an
infallible thinker, when he had time given him;
but he was not always a quick thinker, and on this
occasion he was driven to think quickly. In consequence
he not only erred in repudiating the opinions
of the best military advisers, but even upon
the basis of his own views he made a mistake. The
very fact that he was so energetic in the endeavor
to &quot;trap&quot; Jackson in retreat indicates his understanding
of the truth that Jackson had so small a
force that his prompt retreat was a necessity. This
being so, he was in the distinct and simple position
of making a choice between two alternatives, viz.:
either to endeavor to catch Jackson, and for this
object to withhold what was needed by and had
been promised to McClellan for his campaign
against Richmond; or, leaving Jackson to escape
with impunity, to pursue with steadiness that plan
which it was Jackson's important and perfectly
understood errand to interrupt. It is almost incredible
that he chose wrong. The statement of
<!-- Image No 68 --><a name='Png68'></a><a name='Page058'></a><span class="pagenum">058</span>the dilemma involved the decision. Yet he took
the little purpose and let the great one go. Nor
even thus did he gain this lesser purpose. He
had been warned by McDowell that Jackson could
not be caught, and he was not. Yet even had this
been otherwise, the Northerners would have got
little more than the shell while losing the kernel.
Probably Richmond, and possibly the Southern
army, fell out of the President's hand while he
tried without success to close it upon Jackson and
15,000 men.</p>

<p>The result of this civilian strategy was that
McClellan, with his projects shattered, was left
with his right wing and rear dangerously exposed.
Jackson remained for a while a mysterious <i>b&ecirc;te
noire</i>, about whose force, whereabouts, and intentions
many disturbing rumors flew abroad; at last,
on June 26, he settled these doubts in his usual
sharp and conclusive way by assailing the exposed
right wing and threatening the rear of the Union
army, thus achieving &quot;the brilliant conclusion of
the operations which [he] had so successfully conducted
in the Valley of Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the slipping of Jackson betwixt
his two pursuers on May 31, General Johnston
made an attack upon the two corps<a name='FNanchor_22_22'></a><a href='#Footnote_22_22'><sup>[22]</sup></a> which
lay south of the Chickahominy, in position about
Seven Pines and Fair Oaks. Battle was waged
during two days. Each side claimed a victory; the
Southerners because they had inflicted the heavier
<!-- Image No 69 --><a name='Png69'></a><a name='Page059'></a><span class="pagenum">059</span>loss, the Northerners because ultimately they held
their original lines and foiled Johnston's design of
defeating and destroying the Northern army in
detail. The result of this battle ought to have
proved to McClellan two facts: that neither in discipline
nor in any other respect were the Southern
troops more formidable than his own; also that the
Southerners were clearly not able to overwhelm
him with such superior numbers as he had supposed;
for in two days they had not been able to
overwhelm much less than half of his army. These
considerations should have encouraged him to energetic
measures. But no encouragement could
counteract the discouragement inflicted by the loss
of McDowell's powerful corps and the consequent
wrecking of his latest plan. Nearly to the end of
June he lay immovable. &quot;June 14, midnight. All
quiet in every direction,&quot;&mdash;thus he telegraphed
to Stanton in words intended to be reassuring,
but in fact infinitely vexatious. Was he, then, set
at the head of this great and costly host of the
nation's best, to rest satisfied with preserving an
eternal quietude,&mdash;like a chief of police in a disorderly
quarter? Still he was indefatigable in
declaring himself outnumbered, and in demanding
more troops; in return he got assurances, with
only the slight fulfillment of McCall's division.
Every two or three days he cheeringly announced
to the administration that he was on the verge of
advancing, but he never passed over the verge.
Throughout a season in which blundering seemed
<!-- Image No 70 --><a name='Png70'></a><a name='Page060'></a><span class="pagenum">060</span>to become epidemic, no blunder was greater than
his quiescence at this time.<a name='FNanchor_23_23'></a><a href='#Footnote_23_23'><sup>[23]</sup></a> As if to emphasize
it, about the middle of June General Stuart, with
a body of Confederate cavalry, actually rode all
around the Union army, making the complete circuit
and crossing its line of communication with
White House without interruption. The foray
achieved little, but it wore the aspect of a signal
and unavenged insult.</p>

<p>In Washington the only powerful backing upon
which McClellan could still rely was that of the
President, and he was surely wearing away the
patience of his only friend by the irritating attrition
of promises ever reiterated and never redeemed.
No man ever kept his own counsel more
closely than did Mr. Lincoln, and the indications
of his innermost sentiments concerning McClellan
at this time are rare. But perhaps a little ray is
let in, as through a cranny, by a dispatch which
he sent to the general on June 2: &quot;With these
continuous rains I am very anxious about the
Chickahominy,&mdash;so close in your rear, and crossing
your line of communication. Please look to
it.&quot; This curt prompting on so obvious a point
was a plain insinuation against McClellan's military
competence, and suggests that ceaseless harassment
had at last got the better of Lincoln's
usually imperturbable self-possession; for it lacked
little of being an insult, and Mr. Lincoln, in all his
<!-- Image No 71 --><a name='Png71'></a><a name='Page061'></a><span class="pagenum">061</span>life, never insulted any man. As a spot upon a
white cloth sets off the general whiteness, so this
dispatch illustrates Lincoln's unweariable patience
and long-suffering without parallel. McClellan,
never trammeled by respect, retorted sharply:
&quot;As the Chickahominy has been almost the only
obstacle in my way for several days, your excellency
may rest assured that it has not been overlooked.&quot;
When finally the general became active,
it was under the spur of General Jackson, not of
President Lincoln. Jackson compelled him to
decide and act; and the result was his famous
southward movement to the James River. Some,
adopting his own nomenclature, have called this a
change of base; some, less euphemistically, speak
of it as a retreat. According to General Webb,
it may be called either the one or the other with
equal propriety, for it partook of the features of
each.<a name='FNanchor_24_24'></a><a href='#Footnote_24_24'><sup>[24]</sup></a> It is no part of the biographer of Lincoln
to narrate the suffering and the gallantry of the
troops through those seven days of continuous
fighting and marching, during which they made
their painful way, in the face of an attacking
army, through the dismal swamps of an unwholesome
region, amid the fierce and humid heats of
the Southern summer. On July 1 they closed the
dread experience by a brilliant victory in the desperate,
prolonged, and bloody battle of Malvern
Hill.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 72 --><a name='Png72'></a><a name='Page062'></a><span class="pagenum">062</span>
In the course of this march a letter was sent by
McClellan to Stanton which has become famous.
The vindictive lunge, visibly aimed at the secretary,
was really designed, piercing this lesser functionary,
to reach the President. Even though
written amid the strain and stress of the most critical
and anxious moment of the terrible &quot;Seven
Days,&quot; the words were unpardonable. The letter
is too long to be given in full, but the closing sentences
were:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that a few thousand more men would
have changed this battle<a name='FNanchor_25_25'></a><a href='#Footnote_25_25'><sup>[25]</sup></a> from a defeat to a victory.
As it is, the government must not and cannot
hold me responsible for the result. I feel too
earnestly to-night. I have seen too many dead
and wounded comrades to feel otherwise than that
the government has not sustained this army. If
you do not do so now, the game is lost. If I save
this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no
thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington.
You have done your best to sacrifice this
army.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_26_26'></a><a href='#Footnote_26_26'><sup>[26]</sup></a> It was safe to write thus to Mr. Lincoln,
whose marvelous magnanimity was never
<!-- Image No 73 --><a name='Png73'></a><a name='Page063'></a><span class="pagenum">063</span>soiled by a single act of revenge; but the man who
addressed such language to Stanton secured a
merciless and unscrupulous enemy forever.</p>

<p>Though, at the close of this appalling week, the
troops at last were conquerors on the banks of the
James, they were in a position not permanently
tenable, and before they could rest they had to
fall back another march to Harrison's Landing.
The rear guard reached this haven on the night of
July 3, and the army, thus at last safely placed
and in direct communication with the fleet and the
transports, was able to recuperate,<a name='FNanchor_27_27'></a><a href='#Footnote_27_27'><sup>[27]</sup></a> while those in
authority considered of the future. Certain facts
were established: first, concerning the army,&mdash;
that before it met the baptism of heavy fighting
it had been brought into a splendid condition of
drill and efficiency, and that by that baptism, so
severe and so long continued, it had come as near
as volunteers could come to the excellence of veterans
and regulars; also that it was at least a match
for its opponents; and, finally, strange to say, it
was very slightly demoralized, would soon again
be in condition for an advance, and felt full confidence
and strong affection for its commander.
Brilliant and enthusiastic tributes have been paid
to these men for their endurance amid disease
and wounds and battle; but not one word too
<!-- Image No 74 --><a name='Png74'></a><a name='Page064'></a><span class="pagenum">064</span>much has been said. It is only cruel to think of
the hideous price which they had paid, and by
which they had bought only the capacity to endure
further perils and hardship. Second, concerning
McClellan; it was to be admitted that his predictions
as to points of strategy had been fulfilled;
that he had managed his retreat, or &quot;change of
base,&quot; with skill, and had shown some qualities
of high generalship; but it was also evident that
he was of a temperament so unenterprising and
apprehensive as to make him entirely useless in an
offensive campaign. Yet the burden of conducting
a successful offense lay upon the North. Must
Mr. Lincoln, then, finally accept the opinion of
those who had long since concluded that McClellan
was not the man for the place?</p>

<p>A collateral question was: What should be done
next? McClellan, tenacious and stubborn, was for
persisting in the movement against Lee's army and
Richmond. He admitted no other thought than
that, having paused to gather reinforcements and
to refresh his army, he should assume the offensive,
approaching the city by the south and southwest
from the James River base. Holding this
purpose, he was impolitic in sending very dolorous
dispatches on July 4 and 7, intimating doubts as
to his power to maintain successfully even the defensive.
Two or three days later, however, he
assumed a better tone; and on July 11 and 12 he
reported &quot;all in fine spirits,&quot; and urged that his
army should be &quot;promptly reinforced and thrown
<!-- Image No 75 --><a name='Png75'></a><a name='Page065'></a><span class="pagenum">065</span>again upon Richmond. If we have a little more
than half a chance, we can take it.&quot; He continued
throughout the month to press these views by
arguments which, though overruled at the time,
have since been more favorably regarded. Whether
or not they were correct is an item in the long
legacy of questions left by the war to be disputed
over by posterity; in time, one side or the other
may desist from the discussion in weariness, but,
from the nature of the case, neither can be vanquished.</p>

<p>Whether McClellan was right or wrong, his
prestige, fresh as it still remained with his devoted
troops, was utterly gone at Washington, where the
political host was almost a unit against him. The
Committee on the Conduct of the War had long
been bitterly denouncing him; and he had so
abused the secretary of war that even the duplicity
of Mr. Stanton was unequal to the strain of
maintaining an appearance of good understanding.
New military influences also fell into the
same scale. General Pope, the latest &quot;favorite,&quot;
now enjoying his few weeks of authority, endeavored
to make it clear to Mr. Lincoln that to bring
McClellan back from the Peninsula was the only
safe and intelligent course. Further, on July 11,
President Lincoln appointed General Halleck general-in-chief.
It may be said, in passing, that the
appointment turned out to be a very bad mistake;
for Halleck was as dull a man as ever made use of
grand opportunities only to prove his own incompetence.
<!-- Image No 76 --><a name='Png76'></a><a name='Page066'></a><span class="pagenum">066</span>
Now, however, he came well recommended
before Lincoln, and amid novel responsibilities
the merit of any man could only be known
by trial. Halleck did not arrive in Washington
till near the end of the month, then he seemed for
a while in doubt, or to be upon both sides of the
question as to whether the army should be advanced
or withdrawn; but ultimately, in the contemptuous
language of Mr. Swinton, he &quot;added his strident
voice in favor of the withdrawal of the army from
the Peninsula.&quot; This settled the matter; for the
President had decided to place himself under the
guidance of his new military mentor; and, moreover,
his endurance was worn out.</p>

<p>In the way of loyalty the President certainly
owed nothing further to the general. All such
obligations he had exhaustively discharged. In
spite of the covert malicious suggestions and the
direct injurious charges which tortured the air of
the White House and vexed his judgment, he had
sustained McClellan with a constancy which deserved
warm gratitude. This the general never
gave, because he could never forgive Mr. Lincoln
for refusing to subordinate his own views to those
of such a military expert as himself. This point,
it is true, Lincoln never reached; but subject only
to this independence of opinion and action, so long
as he retained McClellan in command, he fulfilled
toward him every requirement of honor and generosity.
The movement across the Peninsula, whatever
construction might possibly be put upon it,
<!-- Image No 77 --><a name='Png77'></a><a name='Page067'></a><span class="pagenum">067</span>seemed in Washington a retreat, and was for the
President a disappointment weighty enough to
have broken the spirit of a smaller man. Yet
Lincoln, instead of sacrificing McClellan as a
scapegoat, sent to him on July 1 and 2 telegrams
bidding him do his best in the emergency and save
his army, in which case the people would rally and
repair all losses; &quot;we still have strength enough
in the country and will bring it out,&quot; he said,&mdash;words
full of cheering resolution unshaded by a
suspicion of reproach, words which should have
come like wine to the weary. The next day, July
3, he sent a dispatch which even McClellan, in
his formal report, described as &quot;kind:&quot; &quot;I am
satisfied that yourself, officers, and men have done
the best you could. All accounts say better fighting
was never done. Ten thousand thanks for it.&quot;
But when it came to judgment and action the
President could not alleviate duty with kindness.
To get information uncolored by passage through
the minds of others, he went down to Harrison's
Landing on July 7, observed all that he could see,
and talked matters over. Prior to this visit it is
supposed that he had leaned towards McClellan's
views, and had inclined to renew the advance.
Nor is it clearly apparent that he learned anything
during this trip which induced him to change
his mind. Rather it seems probable that he maintained
his original opinion until General Halleck
had declared against it, and that then he yielded
to General Halleck as he had before yielded to
<!-- Image No 78 --><a name='Png78'></a><a name='Page068'></a><span class="pagenum">068</span>General McClellan, though certainly with much
less reluctance. At the same time the question
was not considered wholly by itself, but was almost
necessarily complicated with the question of
deposing McClellan from the command. For the
inconsistency of discrediting McClellan's military
judgment and retaining him at the head of the
army was obvious.</p>

<p>Thus at last it came about that McClellan's plan
lost its only remaining friend, and on August 3
came the definite order for the removal of the
army across the Peninsula to Acquia Creek. The
campaign against Richmond was abandoned. McClellan
could not express his indignation at a
policy &quot;almost fatal to our cause;&quot; but his strenuous
remonstrances had no effect; his influence had
passed forever. The movement of the army was
successfully completed, the rear guard arriving at
Yorktown on August 20. Thus the first great
Peninsula campaign came to its end in disappointment
and almost in disaster, amid heart-burnings
and criminations. It was, says General Webb,
&quot;a lamentable failure,&mdash;nothing less.&quot; There
was little hope for the future unless some master
hand could control the discordant officials who
filled the land with the din of their quarreling.
The burden lay upon the President. Fortunately
his good sense, his even judgment, his unexcitable
temperament had saved him from the appearance
or the reality of partisanship and from any entangling
or compromising personal commitments.</p>

In many ways and for many reasons, this story
of the Peninsula has been both difficult and painful
to write. To reach the truth and sound conclusions
in the many quarrels which it has provoked
is never easy, and upon some points seems impossible;
and neither the truth nor the conclusions
are often agreeable. Opinion and sympathy have
gradually but surely tended in condemnation of
McClellan and in favor of Lincoln. The evidence
is conclusive that McClellan was vain, disrespectful,
and hopelessly blind to those non-military but
very serious considerations which should have been
allowed to modify the purely scientific strategy of
the campaign. Also, though his military training
was excellent, it was his misfortune to be placed
amid exigencies for which neither his moral nor
his mental qualities were adapted. Lincoln, on
the other hand, displayed traits of character not
only in themselves rare and admirable, but so
fitted to the requirements of the times that many
persons have been tempted to conceive him to have
been divinely led. But against this view, though
without derogating from the merits which induce
it, is to be set the fact that he made mistakes
hardly consistent with the theory of inspiration by
Omniscience. He interfered in military matters;
and, being absolutely ignorant of military science,
while the problems before him were many and
extremely perplexing, he blundered, and on at
least one occasion blundered very badly. After he
has been given the benefit of all the doubt which
<!-- Image No 80 --><a name='Png80'></a><a name='Page070'></a><span class="pagenum">070</span>can be suggested concerning the questions which he
disposed of, the preponderance of expert authority
shows a residuum of substantial certainty against
him. It is true that many civilian writers have
given their judgments in favor of the President's
strategy, with a tranquil assurance at least equal
to that shown by the military critics. But it seems
hardly reasonable to suppose that Mr. Lincoln became
by mere instinct, and instantly, a master in
the complex science of war, and it is also highly
improbable that in the military criticism of this
especial campaign, the civilians are generally right
and the military men are generally wrong. On
the whole it is pleasanter as well as more intelligent
to throw out this foolish notion of miraculous
knowledge suddenly illuminating Mr. Lincoln with
a thorough mastery of the art of war. It is better
not to believe that he became at once endowed
with acquirements which he had never had an
opportunity to attain, and rather to be content
with holding him as a simple human being like the
rest of us, and so to credit our common humanity
with the inspiring excellence of the moral qualities
displayed by him in those months of indescribable
trial.</p>

<p>How much of expectation had been staked upon
that army of the Potomac! All the Northern
people for nearly a year kept their eyes fastened
with aching intensity upon it; good fortunes which
befell elsewhere hardly interrupted for a moment
the absorption in it. The feeling was well illustrated
<!-- Image No 81 --><a name='Png81'></a><a name='Page071'></a><span class="pagenum">071</span>
by the committee of Congress, which said
that in the history of this army was to be found all
that was necessary for framing a report on the
Conduct of the War; and truly added that this
army had been &quot;the object of special care to every
department of the government.&quot; It occurred to
many who heard this language, that matters would
have gone better with the army if the political and
civil departments had been less lavish of care and
attention. None the less the fact remained that the
interest and anticipation of the whole loyal part
of the nation were concentrated in the Virginia
campaign. Correspondingly cruel was the disappointment
at its ultimate miscarriage. Probably,
as a single trial, it was the most severe that Mr.
Lincoln ever suffered. Hope then went through
the painful process of being pruned by failure, and
it was never tortured by another equal mutilation.
Moreover, the vastness of the task, the awful cost
of success, were now, for the first time, appreciated.
The responsibility of a ruler under so appalling
a destiny now descended with a weight that
could never become greater upon the shoulders of
that lonely man in the White House. A solitary
man, indeed, he was, in a solitude impressive and
painful to contemplate. Having none of those
unofficial counselors, those favorites, those privy
confidants and friends, from whom men in chief
authority are so apt to seek relief, Mr. Lincoln
secretively held his most important thoughts in his
own mind, wrought out his conclusions by the toil
<!-- Image No 82 --><a name='Png82'></a><a name='Page072'></a><span class="pagenum">072</span>of his own brain, carried his entire burden wholly
upon his own shoulders, and in every part and way
met the full responsibility of his office in and by
himself alone. It does not appear that he ever
sought to be sustained or comforted or encouraged
amid disaster, that he ever endeavored to shift
upon others even the most trifling fragment of the
load which rested upon himself; and certainly he
never desired that any one should ever be a sharer
in any ill repute attendant upon a real or supposed
mistake. Silent as to matters of deep import,
self-sustained, facing alone all grave duties,
solving alone all difficult problems, and enduring
alone all consequences, he appears a man so isolated
from his fellow men amid such tests and
trials, that one is filled with a sense of awe, almost
beyond sympathy, in the contemplation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2>THE THIRD AND CLOSING ACT OF THE MCCLELLAN
DRAMA</h2>

<p>As it seems probable that Mr. Lincoln did not
conclusively determine against the plan of McClellan
for renewing the advance upon Richmond by
way of Petersburg, until after General Halleck
had thus decided, so it is certain that afterward
he allowed to Halleck a control almost wholly free
from interference on his own part. Did he, perchance,
feel that a lesson had been taught him, and
did he think that those critics had not been wholly
wrong who had said that he had intermeddled
ignorantly and hurtfully in military matters? Be
this as it might, it was in accordance with the
national character to turn the back sharply upon
failure and disappointment, and to make a wholly
fresh start; and it was in accordance with Lincoln's
character to fall in with the popular feeling.
Yet if a fresh start was intrinsically advisable, or
if it was made necessary by circumstances, it was
made in unfortunate company. One does not
think without chagrin that Grant, Sherman, Sheridan
lurked undiscovered among the officers at the
West, while Halleck and Pope were pulled forth to
<!-- Image No 84 --><a name='Png84'></a><a name='Page074'></a><span class="pagenum">074</span>the light and set in the high places. Halleck was
hopelessly incompetent, and Pope was fit only for
subordinate command; and by any valuation which
could reasonably be put upon McClellan, it was
absurd to turn him out in order to bring either
of these men in. But it was the experimental
period. No man's qualities could be known except
by testing them; and these two men came
before Lincoln with records sufficiently good to
entitle them to trial. The successes at the West
had naturally produced good opinions of the officers
who had achieved them, and among these
officers John Pope had been as conspicuous as
any other. For this reason he was now, towards
the close of June, 1862, selected to command the
&quot;Army of Virginia,&quot; formed by uniting the corps
of Fremont, McDowell, and Banks.<a name='FNanchor_28_28'></a><a href='#Footnote_28_28'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Fremont resigned,
in a pet at having an officer who was his
junior in the service placed over his head; but he
was no loss, since his impetuous temperament did
not fit him for the duties of a corps commander.
He was succeeded by General Sigel. The fusing
of these independent commands, whose separate
existence had been a wasteful and jeopardizing
error, was an excellent measure.</p>

<p>General Pope remained in Washington a few
weeks, in constant consultation with the administration.
How he impressed Lincoln one would
gladly know, but cannot. He had unlimited self-confidence,
<!-- Image No 85 --><a name='Png85'></a><a name='Page075'></a><span class="pagenum">075</span>
and he gave it to be understood at once
that he was a fighting man; but it showed an astounding
lack of tact upon his part that, in notifying
the troops of this, his distinguishing characteristic,
he also intimated that it would behoove
them to turn over a new leaf now that he had come
all the way from the West in order to teach Eastern
men how to win victories! The manifesto which
he issued has become famous by its folly; it was
arrogant, bombastic, little short of insulting to the
soldiers of his command, and laid down principles
contrary to the established rules of war. Yet it
had good qualities, too; for it was designed to be
stimulating; it certainly meant fighting; and fortunately,
though Pope was not a great general, he
was by no means devoid of military knowledge
and instincts, and he would not really have committed
quite such blunders as he marked out for
himself in his rhetorical enthusiasm. On the whole,
however, the manifesto did harm; neither officers
nor soldiers were inclined to receive kindly a man
who came presumably on trial with the purpose of
replacing McClellan, whom they loved with deep
loyalty; therefore they ridiculed part of his address
and took offense at the rest of it. Mr. Lincoln
could hardly have been encouraged; but he
gave no sign.</p>

<p>On July 29 Pope left Washington and joined
his army, near Culpepper. He had not quite
45,000 men, and was watched by Jackson, who
lay near Gordonsville with a scant half of that
<!-- Image No 86 --><a name='Png86'></a><a name='Page076'></a><span class="pagenum">076</span>number. On August 9 Banks was pushed forward
to Cedar Mountain, where he encountered Jackson
and attacked him. In &quot;a hard-fought battle,
fierce, obstinate, sanguinary,&quot; the Federals were
worsted; and such consolation as the people got
from the gallantry of the troops was more than
offset by the fact, which became obvious so soon
as the whole story was known, that our generals
ought to have avoided the engagement and were
outgeneraled both in the bringing it on and in
the conducting it.</p>

<p>Greatly as Jackson was outnumbered by Pope,
he could hope for no reinforcements from Lee so
long as McClellan, at Harrison's Landing, threatened
Richmond. But when gratifying indications
showed the purpose to withdraw the Northern army
from the Peninsula the Southern general ventured,
August 13, to dispatch General Longstreet northward
with a strong force. Soon afterward he himself
followed and took command. Then for two or
three days ensued a sharp matching of wits betwixt
the two generals. By one of those audacious plans
which Lee could dare to make when he had such
a lieutenant as Jackson to carry it out, Jackson
was sent upon a rapid march by the northward,
around the army of Pope, to cut its communications.
He did it brilliantly; but in doing it he
necessarily offered to Pope such an opportunity for
fighting the Southern forces in detail as is rarely
given by a good general to an adversary whom he
fears. Pope would fain have availed himself of
<!-- Image No 87 --><a name='Png87'></a><a name='Page077'></a><span class="pagenum">077</span>the chance, and in the effort to do so he hurried
his troops hither and thither, mingled wise moves
with foolish ones, confused his subordinates, fatigued
his men, and finally accomplished nothing.
Jackson retired safely from his dangerous position,
rejoined the rest of the Southern army, and
then the united force had as its immediate purpose
to fight Pope before he could receive reinforcements
from McClellan's army, now rapidly coming
forward by way of Washington. <i>E converso</i>,
Pope's course should have been to retire a day's
march across Bull Run and await the additional
troops who could at once join him there. Unfortunately,
however, he still felt the sting of the
ridicule which his ill-starred manifesto had called
forth, and was further irritated by the unsatisfactory
record of the past few days, and therefore was
in no temper to fall back. So he did not, but
stayed and fought what is known as the second
battle of Bull Run. In the conflict his worn-out
men showed such constancy that the slaughter on
both sides was great. Again, however, the bravery
of the rank and file was the only feature which the
country could contemplate without indignation.
The army was beaten; and retired during the
evening of August 30 to a safe position at Centreville,
whither it should have been taken without
loss two days earlier.<a name='FNanchor_29_29'></a><a href='#Footnote_29_29'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Thus was fulfilled, with
<!-- Image No 88 --><a name='Png88'></a><a name='Page078'></a><span class="pagenum">078</span>only a trifling inaccuracy in point of time, the
prediction made by McClellan on August 10, that
&quot;Pope will be badly thrashed within ten days.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_30_30'></a><a href='#Footnote_30_30'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p>In all this manoeuvring and fighting the commanding
general had shown some capacity, but
very much less than was indispensable in a commander
who had to meet the generals of the South.
Forthwith, also, there broke out a series of demoralizing
quarrels among the principal officers as to
what orders had been given and received, and
whether or not they had been understood or misunderstood,
obeyed or disobeyed. Also the enemies
of General McClellan tried to lay upon him
the whole responsibility for the disaster, on the
ground that he had been dilatory, first, in moving
his army from Harrison's Landing, and afterward,
in sending his troops forward to join Pope;
whereas, they said, if he had acted promptly, the
Northern army would have been too strong to
have been defeated, regardless of any incompetence
in the handling of it. Concerning the former
charge, it may be said that dispatches had
flown to and fro between Halleck and McClellan
<!-- Image No 89 --><a name='Png89'></a><a name='Page079'></a><span class="pagenum">079</span>like bullets between implacable duelists; Halleck
ordered the army to be transported, and McClellan
retorted that he was given no transports; it
is a dispute which cannot be discussed here. Concerning
the other charge, it was also true that
the same two generals had been for some days
exchanging telegrams, but had been entirely unable
to understand each other. Whose fault it was
cannot easily be determined. The English language
was giving our generals almost as much
trouble as were the Southerners at this time;
so that in a few short weeks material for endless
discussion was furnished by the orders, telegrams,
and replies which were bandied between Pope and
Porter, McClellan and Halleck. A large part of
the history of the period consists of the critical
analysis and construing of these documents. What
did each in fact mean? What did the writer intend
it to mean? What did the recipient understand
it to 'mean? Did the writer make his meaning
sufficiently clear? Was the recipient justified
in his interpretation? Historians have discussed
these problems as theologians have discussed puzzling
texts of the New Testament, with not less
acerbity and with no more conclusive results. Unquestionably
the capacity to write two or three
dozen consecutive words so as to constitute a plain,
straightforward sentence would have been for the
moment a valuable adjunct to military learning.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat brought dismay, but not
quite a panic, to the authorities in Washington.
<!-- Image No 90 --><a name='Png90'></a><a name='Page080'></a><span class="pagenum">080</span>In fact, there was no immediate danger for the
capital. The army from the Peninsula was by
this time distributed at various points in the immediate
neighborhood; and a force could be promptly
brought together which would so outnumber the
Confederate army as to be invincible. Yet the
situation demanded immediate and vigorous action.
Some hand must seize the helm at once, and Pope's
hand would not do; so much at least was entirely
certain. He had been given his own way, without
interference on the part of President or secretary,
and he had been beaten; he was discredited before
the country and the army; nothing useful could
now be done with him. Halleck was utterly demoralized,
and was actually reduced to telegraphing
to McClellan: &quot;I beg of you to assist me, in
this crisis, with your ability and experience.&quot; It
was the moment for a master to take control, and
the President met the occasion. There was only
one thing to be done, and circumstances were such
that not only must that thing be done by him, but
also it must be done by him in direct opposition to
the strenuous insistence of all his official and most
of his self-constituted advisers. It was necessary
to reinstate McClellan.</p>

<p>It was a little humiliating to be driven to this
step. McClellan had lately been kept at Alexandria
with no duty save daily to disintegrate his
own army by sending off to Washington and to
the camp of his own probable successor division
after division of the troops whom he had so long
<!-- Image No 91 --><a name='Png91'></a><a name='Page081'></a><span class="pagenum">081</span>commanded. Greatly mortified, he had begged at
least to be &quot;permitted to go to the scene of battle.&quot;
But he was ignored, as if he were no longer of any
consequence whatsoever. In plain truth it was
made perfectly obvious to him and to all the world
that if General Pope could win a victory the administration
had done with General McClellan.
Mr. Lincoln described the process as a &quot;snubbing.&quot;
Naturally those who were known to be the
chief promoters of this &quot;snubbing,&quot; and to have
been highly gratified by it, now looked ruefully on
the evident necessity of suddenly cutting it short,
and requesting the snubbed individual to assume
the role of their rescuer. McClellan's more prominent
enemies could not and would not agree to
this. Three members of the cabinet even went
so far as formally to put in writing their protest
against restoring him to the command of any army
at all; while Stanton actually tried to frighten the
President by a petty threat of personal consequences.
But this was foolish. The crisis was of
the kind which induced Mr. Lincoln to exercise
power, decisively. On this occasion his impersonal,
unimpassioned temperament left his judgment
free to work with evenness and clearness
amid the whirl of momentous events and the clash
of angry tongues. No one could say that he had
been a partisan either for or against McClellan,
and his wise reticence in the past gave him in the
present the privilege of untrammeled action. So
he settled the matter at once by ordering that
<!-- Image No 92 --><a name='Png92'></a><a name='Page082'></a><span class="pagenum">082</span>McClellan should have command within the defenses
of Washington.</p>

<p>By this act the President gave extreme offense
to the numerous and strenuous band with whom
hatred of the Democratic general had become a
sort of religion; and upon this occasion even
Messrs. Nicolay and Hay seem more inclined to
apologize for their idol than to defend him. In
point of fact, nothing can be more misplaced than
either apology or defense, except criticism. Mr.
Lincoln could have done no wiser thing. He was
simply setting in charge of the immediate business
the man who could do that especial business
best. It was not a question of a battle or a campaign,
neither of which was for the moment imminent;
but it was a question of reorganizing masses
of disorganized troops and getting them into shape
for battles and campaigns in the future. Only the
intensity of hatred could make any man blind to
McClellan's capacity for such work; and what he
might be for other work was a matter of no consequence
just now. Lincoln simply applied to the instant
need the most effective help, without looking
far afield to study remote consequences. Two remarks,
said to have been made by him at this time,
indicate his accurate appreciation of the occasion
and the man: &quot;There is no one in the army who
can man these fortifications and lick these troops
of ours into shape half so well as he can.&quot; &quot;We
must use the tools we have; if he cannot fight
himself, he excels in making others ready to fight.&quot;</p>

On September 1 Halleck verbally instructed
McClellan to take command of the defenses of
Washington, defining this to mean strictly &quot;the
works and their garrisons.&quot; McClellan says that
later on the same day he had an interview with the
President, in which the President said that he had
&quot;always been a friend&quot; of the general, and asked
as a favor that the general would request his personal
friends among the principal officers of the
army to give to General Pope a more sincere and
hearty support than they were supposed to be actually
rendering.<a name='FNanchor_31_31'></a><a href='#Footnote_31_31'><sup>[31]</sup></a> On the morning of September 2,
McClellan says, &quot;The President informed me that
Colonel Keelton had returned from the front; that
our affairs were in a bad condition; that the army
was in full retreat upon the defenses of Washington,
the roads filled with stragglers, etc. He instructed
me to take steps at once to stop and collect
the stragglers; place the works in a proper state
of defense, and go out to meet and take command
of the army, when it approached the vicinity of the
works, then to place the troops in the best position,
&mdash;committing everything to my hands.&quot; By this
evidence, Mr. Lincoln intrusted the fate of the
country and with it his own reputation absolutely
to the keeping of McClellan.</p>

<p>McClellan was in his element in fusing into unity
the disjointed fragments of armies which lay about
in Virginia like scattered ruins. His bitterest
<!-- Image No 94 --><a name='Png94'></a><a name='Page084'></a><span class="pagenum">084</span>tractors have never denied him the gift of organization,
and admit that he did excellent service just
now for a few days. But circumstances soon extended
his field of action, and gave detraction fresh
opportunities. General Lee, in a bold and enterprising
mood, perhaps attributable to the encouraging
inefficiency of his Northern opponents, moved
up the banks of the Potomac and threatened an
irruption into Maryland and even Pennsylvania.
It was absolutely necessary to watch and, at the
right moment, to fight him. For this purpose
McClellan was ordered to move along the north
bank of the river, but under strict injunctions at
first to go slowly and cautiously and not to uncover
Washington. For General Halleck had not fully
recovered his nerve, and was still much disquieted,
especially concerning the capital. Thus the armies
drew slowly near each other, McClellan creeping
forward, as he had been bidden, while Lee, with
his usual energy, seemed able to do with a thousand
men more than any Northern general could
do with thrice as many, and ran with exasperating
impunity those audacious risks which, where they
cannot be attributed to ignorance on the part of a
commander, indicate contempt for his opponent.
This feeling, if he had it, must have received agreeable
corroboration from the clumsy way in which
the Federals just at this time lost Harper's Ferry,
with General Miles's garrison. The Southern
troops, who had been detailed against it, rapidly
rejoined General Lee's army; and again the people
<!-- Image No 95 --><a name='Png95'></a><a name='Page085'></a><span class="pagenum">085</span>saw that the South had outmarched and outgeneraled
the North.</p>

<p>With all his troops together, Lee was now ready
to fight at the convenience or the pleasure of McClellan,
who seemed chivalrously to have deferred
his attack until his opponent should be prepared
for it! The armies were in presence of each other
near where the Antietam empties into the Potomac,
and here, September 17, the bloody conflict took
place.</p>

<p>The battle of Antietam has usually been called
a Northern victory. Both the right and the left
wings of the Northern army succeeded in seizing
advanced positions and in holding them at the end
of the fight; and Lee retreated to the southward,
though it is true that before doing so he lingered
a day and gave to his enemy a chance, which was
not used, to renew the battle. His position was
obviously untenable in the face of an outnumbering
host. But though upon the strength of these facts
a victory could be claimed with logical propriety,
yet the President and the country were, and had
a right to be, indignant at the very unsatisfactory
proportion of the result to the means. Shortly before
the battle McClellan's troops, upon the return
to them of the commander whom they idolized, had
given him a soul-stirring reception, proving the
spirit and confidence with which they would fight
under his orders; and they went into the fight in
the best possible temper and condition. On the
day of the battle the Northern troops outnumbered
<!-- Image No 96 --><a name='Png96'></a><a name='Page086'></a><span class="pagenum">086</span>the Southerners by nearly two to one; in fact, the
Southern generals, in their reports, insisted that
they had been simply overwhelmed by enormous
odds against which it was a marvel of gallantry for
their men to stand at all. The plain truth was that
in the first place, by backwardness in bringing
on the battle, McClellan had left Lee to effect a
concentration of forces which ought never to have
been permitted. Next, the battle itself had not
been especially well handled, though perhaps this
was due rather to the lack of his personal attention
during its progress than to errors in his plan. Finally,
his failure, with so large an army, of which
a part at least was entirely fresh, to pursue and
perhaps even to destroy the reduced and worn-out
Confederate force seemed inexplicable and was inexcusable.</p>

<p>The South could never be conquered in this way.
It had happened, on September 12, that President
Lincoln heard news apparently indicating the
withdrawal of Lee across the Potomac. He had at
once sent it forward to McClellan, adding: &quot;Do
not let him get off without being hurt.&quot; Three
days later, he telegraphed: &quot;Destroy the rebel
army if possible.&quot; But McClellan had been too
self-restrained in his obedience. He had, indeed,
hurt Lee, but he had been very careful not to hurt
him too much; and as for destroying the rebel
army, he seemed unwilling to enter so lightly on so
stupendous an enterprise. The administration and
the country expected, and perfectly fairly expected,
<!-- Image No 97 --><a name='Png97'></a><a name='Page087'></a><span class="pagenum">087</span>to see a hot pursuit of General Lee. They were
disappointed; they saw no such thing, but only
saw McClellan holding his army as quiescent as
if there was nothing more to be done, and declaring
that it was in no condition to move!</p>

<p>It was intolerably provoking, unintelligible, and
ridiculous that a ragged, ill-shod, overworked,
under-fed, and beaten body of Southerners should
be able to retreat faster than a great, fresh, well-fed,
well-equipped, and victorious body of Northerners
could follow. Jackson said that the Northern
armies were, kept in too good condition; and
declared that he could whip any army which
marched with herds of cattle behind it. But the
North preferred, and justly, to attribute the inefficiency
of their troops to the unfortunate temperament
of the commander. Mr. Lincoln looked at
the unsatisfactory spectacle and held his hand as
long as he could, dreading perhaps again to seem
too forward in assuming control of military affairs.
Patience, however, could not endure forever, nor
common sense be always subservient to technical
science. Accordingly, on October 6, he ordered
McClellan to cross the Potomac, and either to
&quot;give battle to the enemy, or to drive him south.&quot;
McClellan paid no attention to the order. Four
days later the Confederate general, Stuart, with
2000 cavalry and a battery, crossed into Maryland
and made a tour around the Northern army, with
the same insolent success which had attended his
like enterprise on the Peninsula. On October 13
<!-- Image No 98 --><a name='Png98'></a><a name='Page088'></a><span class="pagenum">088</span>the President wrote to McClellan a letter, so admirable
both in temper and in the soundness of its
suggestions that it should be given entire:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p>&quot;MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;You remember my speaking
to you of what I called your over-cautiousness.
Are you not over-cautious when you assume that
you cannot do what the enemy is constantly doing?
Should you not claim to be at least his equal in
prowess, and act upon the claim?</p>

<p>&quot;As I understand, you telegraphed General
Halleck that you cannot subsist your army at Winchester,
unless the railroad from Harper's Ferry
to that point be put in working order. But the
enemy does now subsist his army at Winchester
at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad
transportation as you would have to do without
the railroad last named. He now wagons from
Culpepper Court House, which is just about twice
as far as you would have to do from Harper's
Ferry. He is certainly not more than half as well
provided with wagons as you are. I certainly
should be pleased for you to have the advantage of
the railroad from Harper's Ferry to Winchester;
but it wastes all the remainder of autumn to give
it to you, and, in fact, ignores the question of <i>time</i>,
which cannot and must not be ignored.</p>

<p>&quot;Again, one of the standard maxims of war, as
you know, is 'to operate upon the enemy's communications
as much as possible without exposing
your own.' You seem to act as if this applies
<!-- Image No 99 --><a name='Png99'></a><a name='Page089'></a><span class="pagenum">089</span><i>against</i> you, but cannot apply in your <i>favor</i>.
Change positions with the enemy, and think you
not he would break your communication with Richmond
within the next twenty-four hours? You
dread his going into Pennsylvania. But if he does
so in full force, he gives up his communication to
you absolutely, and you have nothing to do but to
follow and ruin him; if he does so with less than
full force, fall upon and beat what is left behind,
all the easier.</p>

<p>&quot;Exclusive of the water line, you are now nearer
Richmond than the enemy is, by the route that you
<i>can,</i> and he <i>must</i> take. Why can you not reach
there before him, unless you admit that he is more
than your equal on a march? His route is the arc
of a circle, while yours is the chord. The roads
are as good on yours as on his.</p>

<p>&quot;You know I desired, but did not order you,
to cross the Potomac below, instead of above, the
Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. The idea was that
this would at once menace the enemy's communications,
which I would seize, if he would permit. If
he should move northward, I would follow him
closely, holding his communications. If he should
prevent our seizing his communications, and move
towards Richmond, I would press closely to him,
fight him if a favorable opportunity should present,
and at least try to beat him to Richmond on the
inside track. I say, try; if we never try, we shall
never succeed. If he makes a stand at Winchester,
moving neither north nor south, I would fight
<!-- Image No 100 --><a name='Png100'></a><a name='Page090'></a><span class="pagenum">090</span>him there, on the idea that if we cannot beat him
when he bears the wastage of coming to us, we
never can when we bear the wastage of going to
him. This proposition is a simple truth, and is
too important to be lost sight of for a moment.
In coming to us, he tenders us an advantage which
we should not waive. We should not so operate
as to merely drive him away. As we must beat
him somewhere, or fail finally, we can do it, if at
all, easier near to us than far away. If we cannot
beat the enemy where he now is, we never can, he
again being within the intrenchments of Richmond.</p>

<p>&quot;Recurring to the idea of going to Richmond
on the inside track, the facility for supplying from
the side away from the enemy is remarkable, as it
were by the different spokes of a wheel extending
from the hub towards the rim; and this, whether
you moved directly by the chord or on the inside
arc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The
chord line, as you see, carries you by Aldie, Haymarket,
and Fredericksburg, and you see how turnpikes,
railroads, and finally the Potomac, by Acquia
Creek, meet you at all points from Washington.
The same, only the lines lengthened a little, if you
press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way.
The Gaps through the Blue Ridge, I understand
to be about the following distances from Harper's
Ferry, to wit: Vestala, five miles; Gregory's,
thirteen; Snicker's, eighteen; Ashby's, twenty-eight;
Manassas, thirty-eight; Chester, forty-five;
and Thornton's, fifty-three. I should think it
<!-- Image No 101 --><a name='Png101'></a><a name='Page091'></a><span class="pagenum">091</span>preferable to take the route nearest the enemy,
disabling him to make an important move without
your knowledge, and compelling him to keep his
forces together for dread of you. The Gaps would
enable you to attack if you should wish. For a
great part of the way you would be practically between
the enemy and both Washington and Richmond,
enabling us to spare you the greatest number
of troops from here. When, at length, running
for Richmond ahead of him enables him to move
this way, if he does so, turn and attack him in rear.
But I think he should be engaged long before such
point is reached. It is all easy if our troops march
as well as the enemy, and it is unmanly to say they
cannot do it. This letter is in no sense an order.&quot;</p>

<br />

<p>A general who failed to respond to such a spur
as this was not the man for offensive warfare; and
McClellan did not respond. Movement was as odious
to him now as it ever had been, and by talking
about shoes and overcoats, and by other dilatory
pleas, he extended his delay until the close of the
month. It was actually the second day of November
before his army crossed the Potomac. Another
winter of inaction seemed about to begin. It was
simply unendurable. Though it was true that he
had reorganized the army with splendid energy
and skill, and had shown to the Northern soldiers
in Virginia the strange and cheerful spectacle of
the backs of General Lee's soldiers, yet it became
a settled fact that he must give place to some new
<!-- Image No 102 --><a name='Png102'></a><a name='Page092'></a><span class="pagenum">092</span>man. He and Pope were to be succeeded by a
third experiment. Therefore, on November 5,
1862, the President ordered General McClellan to
turn over the command of the army to General
Burnside; and on November 7 this was done.</p>

<p>This action, taken just at this time, called forth
a much more severe criticism than would have
attended it if the removal had been made simultaneously
with the withdrawal from the Peninsula.
By what motive was Mr. Lincoln influenced? Not
very often is the most eager search rewarded by the
sure discovery of his opinions about persons. From
what we know that he did, we try to infer why he
did it, and we gropingly endeavor to apportion the
several measures of influence between those motives
which we choose to put by our conjecture into his
mind; and after our toilful scrutiny is over we
remain painfully conscious of the greatness of the
chance that we have scarcely even approached the
truth. Neither diary nor letters guide us; naught
save reports of occasional pithy, pointed, pregnant
remarks, evidence the most dubious, liable to
be colored by the medium of the predilections of
the hearer, and to be reshaped and misshaped by
time, and by attrition in passing through many
mouths. The President was often in a chatting
mood, and then seemed not remote from his companion.
Yet while this was the visible manifestation
on the surface, he was the most reticent of
men as to grave questions, and no confidant often
heard his inmost thoughts. Especially it would
<!-- Image No 103 --><a name='Png103'></a><a name='Page093'></a><span class="pagenum">093</span>be difficult to name an instance in which he told
one man what he thought of another; a trifling
criticism concerning some single trait was the
utmost that he ever allowed to escape him; a full
and careful estimate, never.</p>

<p>Such reflections come with peculiar force at
this period in his career. What would not one give
for his estimate of McClellan! It would be worth
the whole great collection of characters sketched
by innumerable friends and enemies for that much-discussed
general. While others think that they
know accurately the measure of McClellan's real
value and usefulness, Lincoln really knew these
things; but he never told his knowledge. We only
see that he sustained McClellan for a long while
in the face of vehement aspersions; yet that he
never fully subjected his own convictions to the
educational lectures of the general, and that he
seemed at last willing to see him laid aside; then
immediately in a crisis restored him to authority
in spite of all opposition; and shortly afterward, as
if utterly weary of him, definitively displaced him.
Still, all these facts do not show what Lincoln
thought of McClellan. Many motives besides his
opinion of the man may have influenced him. The
pressure of political opinion and of public feeling
was very great, and might have turned him far
aside from the course he would have pursued if it
could have been neglected. Also other considerations
have been suggested as likely to have
weighed with him,&mdash;that McClellan could do
<!-- Image No 104 --><a name='Png104'></a><a name='Page094'></a><span class="pagenum">094</span>with the army what no other man could do, because
of the intense devotion of both officers and men
to him; and that an indignity offered to McClellan
might swell the dissatisfaction of the Northern
Democracy to a point at which it would seriously
embarrass the administration. These things may
have counteracted, or may have corroborated, Mr.
Lincoln's views concerning the man himself. He
was an extraordinary judge of men in their relationship
to affairs; moreover, of all the men of
note of that time he alone was wholly dispassionate
and non-partisan. Opinions tinctured with
prejudices are countless; it is disappointing that
the one opinion that was free from prejudice is
unknown.<a name='FNanchor_32_32'></a><a href='#Footnote_32_32'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<a name='CHAPTER_IV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2>THE AUTUMN ELECTIONS OF 1862, AND THE
PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION</h2>

<p>The chapter which has been written on &quot;Emancipation
and Politics&quot; shows that while loyalty to
the Union operated as a bond to hold together the
people of the North, slavery entered as a wedge to
force them asunder. It was not long before the
wedge proved a more powerful force than the bond,
for the wedge was driven home by human nature;
and it was inevitable that the men of conservative
temperament and the men of progressive temperament
should erelong be easily restored to their
instinctive antagonism. Of those who had been
stigmatized as &quot;Northern men with Southern principles,&quot;
many soon found their Southern proclivities
reviving. These men, christened &quot;Copperheads,&quot;
became more odious to loyal Northerners
than were the avowed Secessionists. In return for
their venomous nickname and the contempt and
hatred with which they were treated, they themselves
grew steadily more rancorous, more extreme
in their feelings. They denounced and opposed
every measure of the government, harangued vehemently
against the war and against all that was
<!-- Image No 106 --><a name='Png106'></a><a name='Page096'></a><span class="pagenum">096</span>done to prosecute it, reviled with scurrilous and
passionate abuse every prominent Republican, filled
the air with disheartening forecasts of defeat, ruin,
and woe, and triumphed whenever the miserable
prophecies seemed in the way of fulfillment. General
Grant truly described them as auxiliaries to
the Confederate army, and said that the North
would have been much better off with a hundred
thousand of these men in the Southern ranks, and
the rest of their kind at home thoroughly subdued,
as the Unionists were at the South, than was the
case as the struggle was actually conducted. In
time the administration found itself forced, though
reluctantly, to arrest and imprison many of the
ringleaders in this Northern disaffection. Yet all
the while the Copperheads resolutely maintained
their affiliations with the Democratic party, and
though they brought upon it much discredit which
it did not deserve, yet they could not easily be
ejected from it. Differences of opinion shaded
into each other so gradually that to establish a line
of division was difficult.</p>

<p>Impinging upon Copperheadism stood the much
more numerous body of those who persistently asserted
their patriotism, but with equal persistence
criticised severely all the measures of the government.
These men belonged to that well-known
class which is happily described as being &quot;for the
law, but ag'in the enforcement of it.&quot; They were
for the Union, but against saving it. They kept
up a disapproving headshaking over pretty much
<!-- Image No 107 --><a name='Png107'></a><a name='Page097'></a><span class="pagenum">097</span>everything that the President did. With much
grandiloquent argument, in the stately, old-school
style, they bemoaned the breaches which they
charged him with making in the Constitution.
They also hotly assumed the role of champions of
General McClellan, and bewailed the imbecility
of an administration which thwarted and deposed
him. Protesting the purest and highest patriotism,
they were more evasive than the outspoken
Copperheads, and as their disaffection was less
conspicuous and offensive, so also it was more insidious
and almost equally hurtful. They constituted
the true and proper body of Democracy.</p>

<p>In a fellowship, which really ought not to have
existed, with these obstructionists, was the powerful
and respectable body of war Democrats. These
men maintained a stubborn loyalty to the old
party, but prided themselves upon being as hearty
and thorough-going war-men as any among the
Republicans. A large proportion of the most distinguished
generals, of the best regimental officers,
of the most faithful soldiers in the field, were of
this political faith. The only criticism that Republicans
could reasonably pass upon them was,
that they did not, in a political way, strengthen
the hands of the government, that they would not
uphold its authority by swelling its majorities, nor
aid its prestige by giving it their good words.</p>

<p>Over against this Democracy, with its two very
discordant wings, was arrayed the Republican
party, which also was disturbed by the ill-will of
<!-- Image No 108 --><a name='Png108'></a><a name='Page098'></a><span class="pagenum">098</span>those who should have been its allies; for while
the moderate Abolitionists generally sustained the
President, though only imperfectly satisfied with
him, the extreme Abolitionists refused to be so
reasonable. They were a very provoking body
of pure moralists. They worried the President,
condemned his policy, divided the counsels of the
government, and introduced injurious personal enmities
and partisanship with reckless disregard of
probable consequences. To a considerable extent
they had the same practical effect as if they had
been avowed opponents of the Republican President.
They wished immediately to place the war
upon the footing of a crusade for the abolition of
slavery. Among them were old-time Abolitionists,
with whom this purpose was a religion, men who
had hoped to see Seward the Republican President,
and who said that Lincoln's friends in the nominating
convention had represented a &quot;superficial and
only half-hearted Republicanism.&quot; Beside these
men, though actuated by very different and much
less honorable motives, stood many recruits, some
even from the Democracy, who were so vindictive
against the South that they desired to inflict abolition
as a punishment.</p>

<p>All these critics and dissatisfied persons soon
began to speak with severity, and sometimes with
contempt, against the President. He had said that
the war was for the Union; but they scornfully
retorted that this was to reduce it to &quot;a mere
sectional strife for ascendency;&quot; that &quot;a Union,
<!-- Image No 109 --><a name='Png109'></a><a name='Page099'></a><span class="pagenum">099</span>with slavery spared and reinstated, would not be
worth the cost of saving it.&quot; It was true that to
save the Union, without also removing the cause of
disunion, might not be worth a very great price;
yet both Union and abolition were in serious danger
of being thrown away forever by these impetuous
men who desired to pluck the fruit before it
was ripe, or rather declared it to be ripe because
they so wanted to pluck it.</p>

<p>It is not, here and now, a question of the merits
and the usefulness of these men; undoubtedly
their uncompromising ardor could not have been
dispensed with in the great anti-slavery struggle;
it was what the steam is to the engine, and if the
motive power had been absent no one can say how
long the United States might have lain dormant
as a slave-country. But the question is of their
present attitude and of its influence and effect in
the immediate affairs of the government. Their
demand was for an instant and sweeping proclamation
of emancipation; and they were angry and denunciatory
against the President because he would
not give it to them. Of course, by their ceaseless
assaults they hampered him and weakened his
hands very seriously. It was as an exercise of
the President's war-power that they demanded the
proclamation; and the difficulty in the way of it
was that Mr. Lincoln felt, and the great majority
of Northern men were positive in the opinion, that
such a proclamation at this time would not be an
honest and genuine exercise of the war-power, that
<!-- Image No 110 --><a name='Png110'></a><a name='Page100'></a><span class="pagenum">100</span>it would be only falsely and colorably so called,
and that in real truth it would be a deliberate and
arbitrary change of the war from a contest for
Union to a contest for abolition. Mr. Lincoln
could not <i>make</i> it a war measure merely by <i>calling</i>
it so; it was no mere matter of political christening,
but distinctly a very grave and substantial
question of fact. It may be suspected that very
many even of the Abolitionists themselves, had
they spoken the innermost conviction of their
minds, would have admitted that the character of
the measure as a wise military transaction, pure
and simple, was very dubious. It was certain that
every one else in all the country which still was or
ever had been the United States would regard it
as an informal and misnamed but real change of
base for the whole war. No preamble, no <i>Whereas</i>,
in Mr. Lincoln's proclamation, reciting as a fact
and a motive that which he would have known, and
ninety-nine out of every hundred loyal men would
have believed, not to be the true fact and motive,
could make the rest of his proclamation lawful, or
his act that of an honest ruler. Accordingly no
pressure could drive him to the step; he preferred
to endure, and long did endure, the abuse of the
extreme Abolitionists, and all the mischief which
their hostility could inflict upon his administration.
Yet, in truth, there was not in the North an
Abolitionist who thought worse of the institution
of slavery than did the man who had repeatedly
declared it to be &quot;a moral, a social, and a political
<!-- Image No 111 --><a name='Png111'></a><a name='Page101'></a><span class="pagenum">101</span>evil.&quot; Referring to these times, and the behavior
of the Abolitionists, he afterward wrote:<a name='FNanchor_33_33'></a><a href='#Footnote_33_33'><sup>[33]</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not
wrong, nothing is wrong. I cannot remember when
I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never
understood that the presidency conferred upon me
an unrestricted right to act officially upon this
judgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took
that I would, to the best of my ability, preserve,
protect, and defend the Constitution of the United
States. I could not take the office without taking
the oath. Nor was it my view that I might take
an oath to get power, and break the oath in using
the power. I understood, too, that in ordinary
civil administration this oath even forbade me to
practically indulge my primary abstract judgment
on the moral question of slavery. I had publicly
declared this many times, and in many ways. And
I aver that, to this day, I have done no official
act in mere deference to my abstract judgment
and feeling on slavery. I did understand, however,
that my oath to preserve the Constitution to
the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty
of preserving, by every indispensable means, that
government,&mdash;that nation, of which that Constitution
was the organic law. Was it possible to
lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?
By general law, life and limb must be protected,
yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life;
<!-- Image No 112 --><a name='Png112'></a><a name='Page102'></a><span class="pagenum">102</span>but a life is never wisely given to save a limb.
I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional,
might become lawful by becoming indispensable
to the preservation of the Constitution through the
preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed
this ground, and now avow it. I could not
feel that, to the best of my ability, I had even tried
to preserve the Constitution, if, to save slavery
or any minor matter, I should permit the wreck
of government, country, and Constitution all together.
When, early in the war, General Fremont
attempted military emancipation, I forbade it,
because I did not then think it an indispensable
necessity. When, a little later, General Cameron,
then secretary of war, suggested the arming of the
blacks, I objected because I did not yet think it an
indispensable necessity. When, still later, General
Hunter attempted military emancipation, I
again forbade it, because I did not yet think the
indispensable necessity had come.&quot;</p>

<p>None could deny that the North could abolish
slavery in the South only by beating the South in
the pending war. Therefore, by his duty as President
of the Union and by his wishes as an anti-slavery
man, Mr. Lincoln was equally held to win
this fight. Differing in opinion from the Abolitionists,
he believed that to turn it, at an early
stage, into a war for abolition rather than to leave
it a war for the Union would be to destroy all
hope of winning. The step would alienate great
numbers at the North. The &quot;American Society
<!-- Image No 113 --><a name='Png113'></a>
<!-- Image No 114 --><a name='Png114'></a>
<!-- Image No 115 --><a name='Png115'></a><a name='Page103'></a><span class="pagenum">103</span>
for promoting National Unity&quot; had lately declared
that emancipation &quot;would be rebellion against
Providence and destruction to the colored race in
our land;&quot; and it was certain that this feeling was
still widely prevalent in the loyal States. In July,
1862, General McClellan said, warningly, that a
declaration of radical views on the slavery question
would rapidly disintegrate and destroy the Union
armies. Finally, it seemed hardly doubtful that
fatal defections would take place in the Border
States, even if they should not formally go over to
the Confederacy. No man saw the value of those
Border States as Mr. Lincoln did. To save or to
lose them was probably to save or lose the war; to
lose them and the war was to establish a powerful
slave empire. Where did abolition come in among
these events? It was not there!</p>

<p>Painfully, therefore, untiringly, with all the skill
and tact in his power, Mr. Lincoln struggled to
hold those invaluable, crucial States. His &quot;border-state
policy&quot; soon came to be discussed as the
most interesting topic of which men could talk
wherever they came together. Savage were the
maledictions which emancipationists uttered against
it, and the intensity of their feeling is indicated by
the fact that, though that policy was carried out,
and though the nation, in due time, gathered the
ripe and perfect fruit of it both in the integrity
of the country and the abolition of slavery, yet
even at the present day many old opponents of
President Lincoln, survivors of the Thirty-seventh
<!-- Image No 116 --><a name='Png116'></a><a name='Page104'></a><span class="pagenum">104</span>Congress, remain unshaken in the faith that his
famous policy was &quot;a cruel and fatal mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>By the summer of 1862 the opinions and the
action of Mr. Lincoln in all these matters had
brought him into poor standing in the estimation
of many Republicans. The great majority of the
politicians of the party and sundry newspaper editors,
that is to say, those persons who chiefly make
the noise and the show before the world, were busily
engaged in condemning his policy. The headquarters
of this disaffection were in Washington.
It had one convert even within the cabinet, where
the secretary of the treasury was thoroughly
infected with the notion that the President was
fatally inefficient, laggard, and unequal to the occasion.
The feeling was also especially rife in
congressional circles. Mr. Julian, than whom
there can be no better witness, says: &quot;No one at
a distance could have formed any adequate conception
of the hostility of Republican members
toward Mr. Lincoln at the final adjournment [the
middle of July], while it was the belief of many
that our last session of Congress had been held in
Washington. Mr. Wade said the country was
going to hell, and that the scenes witnessed in the
French Revolution were nothing in comparison
with what we should see here.&quot; If most of the
people at the North had not had heads more cool
and sensible than was the one which rested upon
the shoulders of the ardent &quot;Ben&quot; Wade, the
alarming prediction of that lively spokesman might
<!-- Image No 117 --><a name='Png117'></a><a name='Page105'></a><span class="pagenum">105</span>have been fulfilled. Fortunately, however, as Mr.
Julian admits, &quot;the feeling in Congress was far
more intense than [it was] throughout the country.&quot;
The experienced denizens of the large Northern
cities read in a critical temper the tirades of
journalist critics, who assumed to know everything.
The population of the small towns and the village
neighborhoods, though a little bewildered by the
echoes of denunciation which reached them from
the national capital, yet by instinct, or by a divine
guidance, held fast to their faith in their President.
Thus the rank and file of the Republican
party refused to follow the field officers in a revolt
against the general. No better fortune ever befell
this very fortunate nation. If the anti-slavery
extremists had been able to reinforce their own
pressure by the ponderous impact of the popular
will, and so had pushed the President from his
&quot;border-state policy&quot; and from his general scheme
of advancing only very cautiously along the anti-slavery
line, it is hardly conceivable either that
the Union would have been saved or that slavery
would have been destroyed.</p>

<p>On August 19, 1862, the good, impulsive, impractical
Horace Greeley published in his newspaper,
the New York &quot;Tribune,&quot; an address to the
President, to which he gave an awe-inspiring title,
&quot;The Prayer of 20,000,000 of People.&quot; It was
an extremely foolish paper, and its title, like other
parts of it, was false. Only those persons who
were agitators for immediate emancipation could
<!-- Image No 118 --><a name='Png118'></a><a name='Page106'></a><span class="pagenum">106</span>say amen to this mad prayer, and they were far
from being even a large percentage of &quot;20,000,000
of people.&quot; Yet these men, being active missionaries
and loud preachers in behalf of a measure
in which they had perfect faith, made a show and
exerted an influence disproportioned to their numbers.
Therefore their prayer,<a name='FNanchor_34_34'></a><a href='#Footnote_34_34'><sup>[34]</sup></a> though laden with
blunders of fact and reasoning, fairly expressed
malcontent Republicanism. Moreover, multitudes
who could not quite join in the prayer would read
it and would be moved by it. The influence of
the &quot;Tribune&quot; was enormous. Colonel McClure
truly says that by means of it Mr. Greeley
&quot;reached the very heart of the Republican party
in every State in the Union;&quot; and perhaps he does
not greatly exaggerate when he adds that through
this same line of connection the great Republican
editor &quot;was in closer touch with the active loyal
sentiment of the people than [was] even the President
himself.&quot; For these reasons it seemed to
Mr. Lincoln worth while to make a response to
an assault which, if left unanswered, must seriously
<!-- Image No 119 --><a name='Png119'></a><a name='Page107'></a><span class="pagenum">107</span>
embarrass the administration. He therefore
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p>&quot;DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have just read yours of the
19th instant, addressed to myself through the New
York 'Tribune.'</p>

<p>&quot;If there be in it any statements or assumptions
of fact which I may know to be erroneous, I
do not now and here controvert them.</p>

<p>&quot;If there be any inferences which I believe to
be falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue
against them.</p>

<p>&quot;If there be perceptible in it an impatient and
dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old
friend, whose heart I have always supposed to be
right.</p>

<p>&quot;As to the policy 'I seem to be pursuing,' as
you say, I have not meant to leave any one in
doubt. I would save the Union. I would save
it in the shortest way under the Constitution.</p>

<p>&quot;The sooner the national authority can be restored,
the nearer the Union will be,&mdash;the Union
as it was.</p>

<p>&quot;If there be those who would not save the
Union, unless they could at the same time save
slavery, I do not agree with them.</p>

<p>&quot;If there be those who would not save the
Union, unless they could at the same time destroy
slavery, I do not agree with them.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>My paramount object is to save the Union,
and not either to save or destroy slavery</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 120 --><a name='Png120'></a><a name='Page108'></a><span class="pagenum">108</span>
&quot;If I could save the Union without freeing any
slave, I would do it. And if I could save it by
freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if I
could save it by freeing some, and leaving others
alone, I would also do that.</p>

<p>&quot;What I do about slavery and the colored race,
I do because I believe it helps to save the Union,
and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not
believe it would help to save the Union.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall do less whenever I believe what I am
doing hurts the cause, and shall do more whenever
I believe doing more will help the cause.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall try to correct errors when shown to be
errors, and I shall adopt new views so fast as they
shall appear to be true views.</p>

<p>&quot;I have here stated my purpose, according to
my view of official duty, and I intend no modification
of my oft-expressed personal wish, that all
men everywhere could be free.&quot;</p>

<br />

<p>This reply, placing the Union before all else,
did &quot;more to steady the loyal sentiment of the
country in a very grave emergency than anything
that ever came from Lincoln's pen.&quot; It was, very
naturally, &quot;particularly disrelished by anti-slavery
men,&quot; whose views were not modified by it,
but whose temper was irritated in proportion to
the difficulty of meeting it. Mr. Greeley himself,
enthusiastic and woolly-witted, allowed this
heavy roller to pass over him, and arose behind
it unaware that he had been crushed. He even
<!-- Image No 121 --><a name='Png121'></a><a name='Page109'></a><span class="pagenum">109</span>published a retort, which was discreditably abusive.
A fair specimen of his rhetoric was his demand to
be informed whether Mr. Lincoln designed to save
the Union &quot;by recognizing, obeying, and enforcing
the laws, or by ignoring, disregarding, and in fact
defying them.&quot; Now the precise fact which so incensed
Mr. Greeley and all his comrades was that
the President was studiously and stubbornly insisting
upon &quot;recognizing, obeying, and enforcing
the laws;&quot; and the very thing which they were
crying for was a step which, according to his way
of thinking, would involve that he should &quot;ignore,
disregard, and defy&quot; them. They had not shrunk
from taking this position, when pushed toward it.
They had contemned the Constitution, and had
declared that it should not be allowed to stand in
the way of doing those things which, in their opinion,
ought to be done. Their great warrior, the
chieftain of their forces in the House of Representatives,
Thaddeus Stevens, was wont to say,
in his defiant iconoclastic style, that there was no
longer any Constitution, and that he was weary
of hearing this &quot;never-ending gabble about the
sacredness of the Constitution.&quot; Yet somewhat
inconsistently these same men held as an idol and
a leader Secretary Chase; and he at the close of
1860 had declared: &quot;At all hazards and against
all opposition, the laws of the Union should be
enforced.... The question of slavery should not
be permitted to influence my action, one way or
the other.&quot; Later, perhaps he and his allies had
<!-- Image No 122 --><a name='Png122'></a><a name='Page110'></a><span class="pagenum">110</span>forgotten these words. Still many persons hold to
the opinion that the emancipationists did not give
Mr. Lincoln fair play.<a name='FNanchor_35_35'></a><a href='#Footnote_35_35'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p>On September 13 a body of clergymen from
Chicago waited upon Mr. Lincoln to urge immediate
and universal emancipation. The occasion
was made noteworthy by his remarks to them.</p>

<p>&quot;I am approached with the most opposite opinions
and advice, and that by religious men, who are
equally certain that they represent the Divine will.
I am sure that either the one or the other class
is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps, in some
respect, both. I hope it will not be irreverent for
me to say that, if it is probable that God would
reveal his will to others on a point so connected
with my duty, it might be supposed He would
reveal it directly to me; for, unless I am more
deceived in myself than I often am, it is my earnest
desire to know the will of Providence in this
matter. And if I can learn what it is, I will do
it! These are not, however, the days of miracles,
and I suppose it will be granted that I am
not to expect a direct revelation. I must study
the plain physical facts of the case, ascertain what
is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and
right. The subject is difficult, and good men do
not agree.</p>

<p>... &quot;What good would a proclamation of emancipation
from me do, especially as we are now situated?
<!-- Image No 123 --><a name='Png123'></a><a name='Page111'></a><span class="pagenum">111</span>I do not want to issue a document that the whole
world will see must necessarily be inoperative, like
the Pope's bull against the comet! Would my
word free the slaves, when I cannot even enforce
the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there
a single court, or magistrate, or individual that
would be influenced by it there? And what reason
is there to think it would have any greater effect
upon the slaves than the late law of Congress,
which I approved, and which offers protection and
freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come
within our lines? Yet I cannot learn that that
law has caused a single slave to come over to us.</p>

<p>... &quot;Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible
result of good would follow the issuing of such a
proclamation as you desire? Understand, I raise
no objections against it on legal or constitutional
grounds, for, as commander-in-chief of the army
and navy, in time of war, I suppose I have a right
to take any measure which may best subdue the
enemy; nor do I urge objections of a moral nature,
in view of possible consequences of insurrection
and massacre at the South. I view this matter as
a practical war measure, to be decided on according
to the advantages or disadvantages it may
offer to the suppression of the rebellion.</p>

<p>... &quot;Do not misunderstand me because I have mentioned
these objections. They indicate the difficulties
that have thus far prevented my action in
<!-- Image No 124 --><a name='Png124'></a><a name='Page112'></a><span class="pagenum">112</span>some such way as you desire. I have not decided
against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves, but
hold the matter under advisement. And I can
assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day
and night, more than any other. Whatever shall
appear to be God's will I will do. I trust that
in the freedom with which I have canvassed your
views I have not in any respect injured your feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>Whether or not the clerical advisers winced
under the President's irony, at least they must
have appreciated the earnestness and sincerity with
which he considered the subject.</p>

<p>All this while that newspaper writers, religious
teachers, members of Congress, and political busy-bodies
generally were tirelessly enlightening Mr.
Lincoln concerning what was right, what was
wise, what was the will of the people, even what
was the will of God, he was again quietly making
good that shrewd Southerner's prophecy: he was
&quot;doing his own thinking;&quot; neither was he telling
to anybody what this thinking was. Throngs
came and went, and each felt called upon to leave
behind him some of his own wisdom, a precept,
advice, or suggestion, for the use of the President;
perhaps in return he took away with him a story
which was much more than full value for what
he had given; but no one found out the working
of the President's mind, and no one could say that
he had influenced it. History is crowded with
tales of despots, but it tells of no despot who
<!-- Image No 125 --><a name='Png125'></a><a name='Page113'></a><span class="pagenum">113</span>thought and decided with the tranquil, taciturn
independence which was now marking this President
of the free American Republic. It is a
little amusing for us, to-day, to know that while
the emancipationists were angrily growling out
their disgust at the ruler who would not abolish
slavery according to their advice, the rough draft
of the Emancipation Proclamation had already
been written. It was actually lying in his desk
when he was writing to Greeley that letter which
caused so much indignation. It had been communicated
to his cabinet long before he talked to
those Chicago clergymen, and showed them that
the matter was by no means so simple as they, in
their one-sided, unworldly way, believed it to be.</p>

<p>It is said to have been on July 8 that the President
wrote this rough draft, on board the steamboat
which was bringing him back from his visit to
McClellan at Harrison's Landing. He then laid
it away for the days and events to bring ripeness.
By his own statement he had for some time
felt convinced that, if compensated emancipation
should fail, emancipation as a war measure must
ensue. Compensated emancipation had now been
offered, urged, and ill received; therefore the question
in his mind was no longer <i>whether</i>, but <i>when</i>
he should exercise his power. This was more a
military than a political question. His right to
emancipate slaves was strictly a war-power; he
had the right to exercise it strictly for the purpose
of weakening the enemy or strengthening his
<!-- Image No 126 --><a name='Png126'></a><a name='Page114'></a><span class="pagenum">114</span>own generals; he had not the right to exercise it
in the cause of humanity, if it would not either
weaken the enemy or strengthen his own side. If
by premature exercise he should alienate great
numbers of border-state men, while the sheet of
paper with his name at its foot would be ineffectual
to give actual liberty of action to a single black
man in the Confederacy, he would aid the South
and injure the North,&mdash;that is to say, he would
accomplish precisely the reverse of that which
alone could lawfully form the basis of his action.
The question of <i>When</i>, therefore, was a very serious
one. At what stage of the contest would a
declaration of emancipation be hurtful to the
Southern and beneficial to the Northern cause?</p>

<p>Schuyler Colfax well said that Mr. Lincoln's
judgment, when settled, &quot;was almost as immovable
as the eternal hills.&quot; A good illustration of
this was given upon a day about the end of July
or beginning of August, 1862, when Mr. Lincoln
called a cabinet meeting. To his assembled secretaries
he then said, with his usual simple brevity,
that he was going to communicate to them something
about which he did not desire them to offer
any advice, since his determination was taken;
they might make suggestions as to details, but
nothing more. After this imperious statement he
read the preliminary proclamation of emancipation.
The ministers listened in silence; not one of them
had been consulted; not one of them, until this
moment, knew the President's purpose; not even
<!-- Image No 127 --><a name='Png127'></a><a name='Page115'></a><span class="pagenum">115</span>now did he think it worth while to go through any
idle form of asking the opinion of any one of
them.<a name='FNanchor_36_36'></a><a href='#Footnote_36_36'><sup>[36]</sup></a> He alone had settled the matter, and simply
notified them that he was about to do the most
momentous thing that had ever been done upon
this continent since thirteen British colonies had
become a nation. Such a presentation of &quot;one-man-power&quot;
certainly stood out in startling relief
upon the background of popular government and
the great free republican system of the world!</p>

<p>One or two trifling verbal alterations were made.
The only important suggestion came from Mr.
Seward, who said that, in the &quot;depression of the
public mind consequent upon our repeated adverses,&quot;
he feared that so important a step might
&quot;be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted
government, a cry for help; the government
stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia, instead of
Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government.&quot;
He dreaded that &quot;it would be considered
our last shriek on the retreat.&quot; Therefore he
thought it would be well to postpone issuing the
proclamation till it could come before the country
with the support of some military success. Mr.
Lincoln, who had not committed himself upon the
precise point of time, approved this idea. In fact,
he had already had in mind this same notion, that
a victory would be an excellent companion for the
<!-- Image No 128 --><a name='Png128'></a><a name='Page116'></a><span class="pagenum">116</span>proclamation. In July Mr. Boutwell had said to
him that the North would not succeed until the
slaves were emancipated, and Mr. Lincoln had replied:
&quot;You would not have it done now, would
you? Had we not better wait for something like
a victory?&quot; This point being accordingly settled
to the satisfaction of all, the meeting then dissolved,
with the understanding that the secret was
to be closely kept for the present; and Mr. Lincoln
again put away his paper to await the coming
of leaden-footed victory.</p>

<p>For the moment the prospects of this event were
certainly sufficiently gloomy. Less than three
weeks, however, brought the battle of Antietam.
As a real &quot;military success&quot; this was, fairly speaking,
unsatisfactory; but it had to serve the turn;
the events of the war did not permit the North
to be fastidious in using the word victory; if the
President had imprudently been more exacting, the
Abolitionists would have had to wait for Gettysburg.
News of the battle reached Mr. Lincoln at
the Soldiers' Home. &quot;Here,&quot; he says, &quot;I finished
writing the second draft. I came to Washington
on Saturday, called the cabinet together to hear
it, and it was published on the following Monday,
the 22d of September, 1862.&quot;</p>

<p>The proclamation was preliminary or monitory
only, and it did not promise universal emancipation.
It stated that, on January 1, 1863, &quot;all
persons held as slaves within any State or designated
part of a State, the people whereof shall then
<!-- Image No 129 --><a name='Png129'></a><a name='Page117'></a><span class="pagenum">117</span>be in rebellion against the United States, shall be
then, thenceforward, and forever free;&quot; also, that
&quot;the Executive will, on the first day of January
aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States
and parts of States, if any, in which the people
thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion
against the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>The measure was entirely Mr. Lincoln's own.
Secretary Chase reports that at the cabinet meeting
on September 22 he said: &quot;I must do the best
I can, and bear the responsibility of taking the
course which I feel I ought to take.&quot; It has been
said that he acted under a severe specific pressure,
emanating from the calling of the famous conference
of governors at Altoona. This, however, is
not true. On September 14 Governor Curtin invited
the governors of loyal States to meet on September
24 to discuss the situation and especially
the emergency created by the northward advance
of General Lee. But that this meeting was more
than a coincidence, or that the summons to it had
any influence in the matter of the proclamation, is
disproved by all that is known concerning it.<a name='FNanchor_37_37'></a><a href='#Footnote_37_37'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The
connection with the battle is direct, avowed, and
reasonable; that with the gubernatorial congress is
supposititious and improbable. Governor Curtin
says distinctly that the President, being informed
by himself and two others that such a conference
was in preparation, &quot;did not attempt to conceal
<!-- Image No 130 --><a name='Png130'></a><a name='Page118'></a><span class="pagenum">118</span>the fact that we were upon the eve of an emancipation
policy,&quot; in response to which statement he
received from his auditors the &quot;assurance that the
Altoona conference would cordially indorse such a
policy.&quot; As matter of fact, at the meeting, most
of the governors, in a sort of supplementary way,
declared their approval of the proclamation; but
the governors of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
Kentucky, and Missouri would not unite in this
action. If further evidence were needed upon this
point, it is furnished by the simple statement of
President Lincoln himself. He said: &quot;The truth
is, I never thought of the meeting of the governors
at all. When Lee came over the Potomac I made
a resolve that, if McClellan drove him back, I
would send the proclamation after him. The battle
of Antietam was fought Wednesday, but I could
not find out until Saturday whether we had won
a victory or lost a battle. It was then too late to
issue it on that day, and on Sunday I fixed it up a
little, and on Monday I let them have it.&quot; Secretary
Chase, in his Diary, under date of September
22, 1862, gives an account in keeping with the
foregoing sketch, but casts about the proclamation
a sort of superstitious complexion, as if it were
the fulfillment of a religious vow. He says that at
the cabinet meeting the President said: &quot;When the
rebel army was at Frederick, I determined, as soon
as it should be driven out of Maryland, to issue
a proclamation of emancipation, such as I thought
most likely to be useful. I said nothing to any
<!-- Image No 131 --><a name='Png131'></a><a name='Page119'></a><span class="pagenum">119</span>one; but I made the promise to myself, and (hesitating
a little) to my Maker. The rebel army is
now driven out, and I am going to fulfill that promise.&quot;
About an event so important and so picturesque
small legends will cluster and cling like
little barnacles on the solid rock; but the rock remains
the same beneath these deposits, and in this
case the fact that the proclamation was determined
upon and issued at the sole will and discretion of
the President is not shaken by any testimony that
is given about it. He regarded it as a most grave
measure, as plainly it was; to a Southerner, who
had begged him not to have recourse to it, he
replied: &quot;You must not expect me to give up this
government without playing my last card.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_38_38'></a><a href='#Footnote_38_38'><sup>[38]</sup></a> So
now, on this momentous twenty-second day of September,
the President, using his own judgment in
playing the great game, cast what he conceived to
be his ace of trumps upon the table.</p>

<p>The measure took the country by surprise. The
President's secret had been well kept, and for once
rumor had not forerun execution. Doubtless the
reader expects now to hear that one immediate
effect was the conciliation of all those who had
been so long reproaching Mr. Lincoln for his delay
in taking this step. It would seem right and natural
that the emancipationists should have rallied
with generous ardor to sustain him. They did not.
They remained just as dissatisfied and distrustful
towards him as ever. Some said that he had been
<!-- Image No 132 --><a name='Png132'></a><a name='Page120'></a><span class="pagenum">120</span><i>forced</i> into this policy, some that he had drifted
with the tide of events, some that he had waited
for popular opinion at the North to give him the
cue, instead of himself guiding that opinion. To
show that he was false to the responsibility of a
ruler, there were those who cited against him his
own modest words: &quot;I claim not to have controlled
events, but confess plainly that events have
controlled me.&quot; Others, however, put upon this
language the more kindly and more honest interpretation,
that Mr. Lincoln appreciated that both
President and people were moved by the drift of
events, which in turn received their own impulse
from an agency higher than human and to which
they must obediently yield. But whatever ingenious
excuses were devised by extremists for
condemning the man who had done the act, the
Republican party faithfully supported the act itself.
In the middle of December the House passed a
resolution ratifying the President's policy as &quot;well
adapted to hasten the restoration of peace,&quot; and
&quot;well chosen as a war measure.&quot;</p>

<p>The President himself afterward declared his
&quot;conviction&quot; that, had the proclamation been
issued six months earlier, it would not have been
sustained by public opinion; and certainly it is
true that contemporaneous political occurrences
now failed to corroborate the soundness of those
assertions by which the irreconcilable emancipationist
critics of Mr. Lincoln had been endeavoring
to induce him to adopt their policy earlier.
<!-- Image No 133 --><a name='Png133'></a><a name='Page121'></a><span class="pagenum">121</span>They themselves, as Mr. Wilson admits, &quot;had
never constituted more than an inconsiderable
fraction&quot; of the whole people at the North. He
further says: &quot;At the other extreme, larger numbers
received it [the proclamation] with deadly
and outspoken opposition; while between these extremes
the great body even of Union men doubted,
hesitated.... Its immediate practical effect did
perhaps more nearly answer the apprehensions of
the President than the expectations of those most
clamorous for it. It did, as charged, very much
'unite the South and divide the North.'&quot;</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1862 there took place the elections
for Representatives to the Thirty-eighth Congress.
The most ingenious sophist could hardly
maintain that strenuous anti-slavery voters, who
had been angry with the government for backwardness
in the emancipation policy, ought now to
manifest their discontent by voting the Democratic
ticket. If there should be a Democratic reaction
at the polls it could not possibly be construed
otherwise than as a reaction against anti-slavery;
it would undeniably indicate that Congress and
the administration had been too hostile rather than
too friendly towards that cause of the strife, that
they had outstripped rather than fallen behind
popular sympathy. It soon became evident that a
formidable reaction of this kind had taken place,
that dissatisfaction with the anti-slavery measures
and discouragement at the military failures, together,
were even imperiling Republican ascendency.
<!-- Image No 134 --><a name='Png134'></a><a name='Page122'></a><span class="pagenum">122</span>
Now all knew, though some might not be
willing to say, that the loss of Republican ascendency
meant, in fact, the speedy settlement of the
war by compromise; and the South was undoubtedly
in earnest in declaring that there could be no
compromise without disunion. Therefore, in those
elections of the autumn months in 1862 the whole
question of Union or Disunion had to be fought
out at the polls in the loyal States, and there was
an appalling chance of its going against the Unionist
party. &quot;The administration,&quot; says Mr. Blaine,
&quot;was now subjected to a fight for its life;&quot; and
for a while the fortunes of that mortal combat
wore a most alarming aspect.</p>

<p>The Democracy made its fight on the ground
that the anti-slavery legislation of the Republican
majority in the Thirty-seventh Congress had substantially
made abolition the ultimate purpose of
the war. Here, then, they said, was a change of
base; were or were not the voters of the loyal
States willing to ratify it? Already this ground
had been taken in the platforms of the party in the
most important Northern States, before Mr. Lincoln
issued his proclamation. Was it unreasonable
to fear that this latest and most advanced step
would intensify that hostility, stimulate the too
obvious reaction, and aggravate the danger which,
against his judgment,<a name='FNanchor_39_39'></a><a href='#Footnote_39_39'><sup>[39]</sup></a> as it was understood, Congress
<!-- Image No 135 --><a name='Png135'></a><a name='Page123'></a><span class="pagenum">123</span>
had created? Was it not probable that Mr.
Blair was correct when he warned the President
that the proclamation would &quot;cost the administration
the fall elections&quot;? Naturally it will be
asked: if this was a reasonable expectation, why
did the President seize this critical moment to ally
the administration with anti-slavery? Mr. Blaine
furnishes a probable explanation: &quot;The anti-slavery
policy of Congress had gone far enough to
arouse the bitter hostility of all Democrats, who
were not thoroughly committed to the war, and yet
not far enough to deal an effective blow against the
institution.&quot; The administration stood at a point
where safety lay rather in defying than in evading
the ill opinion of the malcontents, where the best
wisdom was to commit itself, the party, and the
nation decisively to the &quot;bold, far-reaching, radical,
and aggressive policy,&quot; from which it would
be impossible afterward to turn back &quot;without
deliberately resolving to sacrifice our nationality.&quot;
Presumably the President wished to show the people
that their only choice now lay between slavery
on the one hand and nationality on the other, so
that, of the two things, they might take that one
which they deemed the more worthy. The two
together they could never again have. This theory
tallies with the well-known fact that Mr. Lincoln
was always willing to trust the people upon a question
of right and wrong. He never was afraid to
stake his chance upon the faith that what was intrinsically
right would prove in the long run to be
<!-- Image No 136 --><a name='Png136'></a><a name='Page124'></a><span class="pagenum">124</span>politically safe. While he was a shrewd politician
in matters of detail, he had the wisdom always in
a great question to get upon that side where the
inherent morality lay. Yet, unfortunately, it takes
time&mdash;time which cannot always be afforded&mdash;for
right to destroy prejudice; the slow-grinding mill
of God grinds sometimes so slowly that man cannot
help fearing that for once the stint will not
be worked out; and in this autumn of 1862 there
was one of these crises of painful anxiety among
patriots at the North.</p>

<p>Maine held her election early in September, and
upon the vote for governor a Republican majority,
which usually ranged from 10,000 to 19,000, was
this year cut down to a little over 4000; also, for
the first time in ten years, a Democrat secured a
seat in the national House of Representatives.
Then came the &quot;October States.&quot; In that dreary
month Ohio elected 14 Democrats and 5 Republicans;
the Democrats casting, in the total, about
7000 more votes than the Republicans. Indiana
sent 8 Democrats, 3 Republicans. In Pennsylvania
the congressional delegation was divided, but
the Democrats polled the larger vote by about
4000; whereas Mr. Lincoln had had a majority
in the State of 60,000! In New York the famous
Democratic leader, Horatio Seymour, was elected
governor by a majority of nearly 10,000. Illinois,
the President's own State, showed a Democratic
majority of 17,000, and her congressional delegation
stood 11 Democrats to 3 Republicans. New
<!-- Image No 137 --><a name='Png137'></a><a name='Page125'></a><span class="pagenum">125</span>Jersey turned from Republicanism to Democracy.
Michigan reduced a Republican majority from
20,000 to 6000. Wisconsin divided its delegation
evenly.<a name='FNanchor_40_40'></a><a href='#Footnote_40_40'><sup>[40]</sup></a> When the returns were all in, the Democrats,
who had had only 44 votes in the House in
the Thirty-seventh Congress, found that in its successor
they would have 75. Even if the non-voting
absentees in the army<a name='FNanchor_41_41'></a><a href='#Footnote_41_41'><sup>[41]</sup></a> had been all Republicans,
which they certainly were not, such a reaction
would have been appalling.</p>

<p>Fortunately some other Northern States&mdash;New
England's six, and Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, California,
and Oregon&mdash;held better to their Republican
faith. But it was actually the border slave
States which, in these dark and desperate days,
came gallantly to the rescue of the President's
party. If the voters of these States had seen in
him a radical of the stripe of the anti-slavery agitators,
it is not imaginable that they would have
helped him as they now did. Thus was his much
maligned &quot;border-state policy&quot; at last handsomely
vindicated; and thanks to it the frightened Republicans
saw, with relief, that they could command
a majority of about twenty votes in the House.
Mr. Lincoln had saved the party whose leaders had
turned against him.</p>

<p>Beneath the dismal shadow of these autumnal
<!-- Image No 138 --><a name='Png138'></a><a name='Page126'></a><span class="pagenum">126</span>elections the Thirty-seventh Congress came together
for its final session, December 1, 1862.
The political situation was peculiar and unfortunate.
There was the greatest possible need for
sympathetic co&ouml;peration in the Republican party;
but sympathy was absent, and co&ouml;peration was imperfect
and reluctant. The majority of the Republican
members of Congress obstinately maintained
their alienation from the Republican President; an
enormous popular defection from Republicanism
had taken place in its natural strongholds; and
Republican domination had only been saved by the
aid of States in which Republican majorities had
been attainable actually because a large proportion
of the population was so disaffected as either to
have enlisted in the Confederate service, or to
have refrained from voting at elections held under
Union auspices. Therefore, whether Mr. Lincoln
looked forth upon the political or the military
situation, he beheld only gloomy prospects. But
having made fast to what he believed to be right,
he would not, in panic, cast loose from it. In the
face of condemnation he was not seen to modify
his course in order to conciliate any portion of
the people; but, on the contrary, in his message
he returned to his plan which had hitherto been
so coldly received, and again strenuously recommended
appropriations for gradual, compensated
emancipation and colonization. The scheme had
three especial attractions for him: 1. It would be
operative in those loyal States and parts of States
<!-- Image No 139 --><a name='Png139'></a><a name='Page127'></a><span class="pagenum">127</span>in which military emancipation would not take
effect. 2. In its practical result it would do away
with slavery by the year 1900, whereas military
emancipation would now free a great number of
individuals, but would leave slavery, as an institution,
untouched and liable to be revived and
reinvigorated later on. 3. It would make emancipation
come as a voluntary process, leaving a
minimum of resentment remaining in the minds of
slaveholders, instead of being a violent war measure
never to be remembered without rebellious
anger. This last point was what chiefly moved
him. He intensely desired to have emancipation
effected in such a way that good feeling between
the two sections might be a not distant condition;
the humanity of his temperament, his passion for
reasonable dealing, his appreciation of the mischief
of sectional enmity in a republic, all conspired to
establish him unchangeably in favor of &quot;compensated
emancipation.&quot;</p>

<p>For the accomplishment of his purpose he now
suggested three articles of amendment to the Constitution.
He spoke earnestly; for &quot;in times like
the present,&quot; he said, &quot;men should utter nothing
for which they would not willingly be responsible
through time and eternity.&quot; Beneath the solemnity
of this obligation he made for his plan a very
elaborate argument. Among the closing sentences
were the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The plan would, I am confident, secure peace
more speedily, and maintain it more permanently,
<!-- Image No 140 --><a name='Png140'></a><a name='Page128'></a><span class="pagenum">128</span>than can be done by force alone; while all it would
cost, considering amounts, and manner of payment,
and times of payment, would be easier paid
than will be the additional cost of the war, if we
rely solely upon force. It is much, very much,
that it would cost no blood at all.</p>

<p>... &quot;Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose,
if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen
its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it
doubted that it would restore the national authority
and national prosperity, and perpetuate both
indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here&mdash;Congress
and Executive&mdash;can secure its adoption?
Will not the good people respond to a united and
earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by
any other means so certainly or so speedily assure
these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert.
It is not 'Can <i>any</i> of us <i>imagine</i> better?'
but; 'Can we <i>all do</i> better?' Object whatsoever
is possible, still the question recurs, 'Can we do
better?' The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate
to the stormy present. The occasion is
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall
ourselves, and then we shall save our country.</p>

<p>&quot;Fellow citizens, <i>we</i> cannot escape history.
We, of this Congress and this administration, will
[shall] be remembered in spite of ourselves. No
personal significance, or insignificance, can spare
<!-- Image No 141 --><a name='Png141'></a><a name='Page129'></a><span class="pagenum">129</span>one or another of us. The fiery trial through
which we pass will light us down, in honor or
dishonor, to the latest generation. We <i>say</i> we are
for the Union. The world will not forget that we
say this. We know how to save the Union. The
world knows we do know how to save it. We&mdash;even
<i>we here</i>&mdash;hold the power and bear the responsibility.
In <i>giving</i> freedom to the <i>slave</i> we
<i>assure</i> freedom to the <i>free</i>,&mdash;honorable alike in
what we give and what we preserve. We shall
nobly save, or meanly lose, the last, best hope of
earth. Other means may succeed; this could not
fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just,&mdash;a
way which, if followed, the world will forever
applaud, and God must forever bless.&quot;</p>

<p>Beautiful and impressive as was this appeal, it
persuaded few or none. In fact, no effort on the
President's part now, or at any time, could win
much approval for his plan. Not many were ever
pleased by it; but afterward, in the winter of 1863,
many members of the Thirty-eighth Congress were
willing, without believing in it, to give him a
chance to try it in Missouri. Accordingly a bill
then passed the House appropriating $10,000,000
to compensate slave-owners in that State, if abolition
of slavery should be made part of its organic
law. The Senate made the sum $15,000,000 and
returned the bill to the House for concurrence.
But the representatives from Missouri were tireless
in their hostility to the measure, and finally
killed it by parliamentary expedients of delay.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 142 --><a name='Png142'></a><a name='Page130'></a><span class="pagenum">130</span>
This was a great disappointment to Mr. Lincoln.
While the measure was pending he argued
strenuously with leading Missourians to induce
them to put their State in the lead in what he
hoped would then become a procession of slave
States. But these gentlemen seemed to fear that,
if they should take United States bonds in payment,
they might awake some morning in these
troublous times to find their promiser a bankrupt
or a repudiationist. On the other hand, such was
the force of habit that a slave seemed to them
very tangible property. Mr. Lincoln shrewdly
suggested that, amid present conditions, &quot;<i>bonds</i>
were better than <i>bondsmen</i>,&quot; and &quot;two-legged
property&quot; was a very bad kind to hold. Time
proved him to be entirely right; but for the present
his argument, entreaty, and humor were all alike
useless. Missouri would have nothing to do with
&quot;compensated emancipation;&quot; and since she was
regarded as a test case, the experiment was not
tried elsewhere. So it came to pass afterward
that the slaveholders parted with their slaves for
nothing instead of exchanging them for the six per
cent. bonds of the United States.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>The first day of January, 1863, arrived, and no
event had occurred to delay the issue of the promised
proclamation. It came accordingly. By
virtue of his power as commander-in-chief, &quot;in
time of actual armed rebellion,... and as a fit
and necessary war measure for suppressing said
<!-- Image No 143 --><a name='Png143'></a><a name='Page131'></a><span class="pagenum">131</span>rebellion,&quot; the President ordered that all persons
held as slaves in certain States and parts of States,
which he designated as being then in rebellion,
should be thenceforward free, and declared that
the Executive, with the army and navy, would
&quot;recognize and maintain the freedom of said
persons.&quot; The word &quot;maintain&quot; was inserted at
Seward's suggestion, and somewhat against Mr.
Lincoln's wish. He said that he had intentionally
refrained from introducing it, because it was not
his way to promise what he was not entirely <i>sure</i>
that he could perform. The sentence invoking
the favor of God was contributed by Secretary
Chase. The paper was signed after the great public
reception of New Year's Day. Mr. Lincoln,
as he took the pen, remarked to Mr. Seward
that his much-shaken hand was almost paralyzed,
so that people who, in time to come, should see
that signature would be likely to say: &quot;He hesitated,&quot;
whereas, in fact, his whole soul was in it.
The publication took place late in the day, and the
anti-slavery critics grumbled because it was not
sent out in the morning.</p>

<p>The people at large received this important step
with some variety of feeling and expression; but,
upon the whole, approval seems to have far outrun
the dubious prognostications of the timid and
conservative class. For the three months which
had given opportunity for thinking had produced
the result which Mr. Lincoln had hoped for. It
turned out that the mill of God had been grinding
<!-- Image No 144 --><a name='Png144'></a><a name='Page132'></a><span class="pagenum">132</span>as exactly as always. Very many who would not
have advised the measure now heartily ratified it.
Later, after men's minds had had time to settle
and the balance could be fairly struck, it appeared
undeniable that the final proclamation had been of
good effect; so Mr. Lincoln himself said.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that while many Englishmen
spoke out in generous praise, the rulers of England
took the contrary position. Earl Russell said that
the measure was &quot;of a very strange nature,&quot; &quot;a
very questionable kind,&quot; an act of &quot;vengeance on
the slave-owner,&quot; and that it did no more than
&quot;profess to emancipate slaves, where the United
States authorities cannot make emancipation a
reality.&quot; But the English people were strongly
and genuinely anti-slavery, and the danger of English
recognition of the Confederacy was greatly
diminished when the proclamation established the
policy of the administration.</p>

<p>The proclamation contained a statement that ex-slaves
would be &quot;received into the armed service
of the United States.&quot; Up to this time not much
had been done in the way of enlisting colored
troops. The negroes themselves had somewhat
disappointed their friends by failing to take the
initiative, and it became evident that they must be
stirred by influences outside their own race. The
President now took the matter in hand, and endeavored
to stimulate commanders of Southern
departments to show energy concerning it. By
degrees successful results were obtained. The
<!-- Image No 145 --><a name='Png145'></a>

<!-- Image No 148 --><a name='Png148'></a>

<!-- Image No 149 --><a name='Png149'></a><a name='Page133'></a><span class="pagenum">133</span>
Southerners formally declared that they would not
regard either negro troops or their officers as prisoners
of war; but that they would execute the officers
as ordinary felons, and would hand over the
negroes to be dealt with by the state authorities as
slaves in insurrection. Painful and embarrassing
questions of duty were presented by these menaces.
To Mr. Lincoln the obvious policy of retaliation
seemed abhorrent, and he held back from declaring
that he would adopt it, in the hope that events
might never compel him to do so. But on July
30 he felt compelled, in justice to the blacks and
those who led them, to issue an order that for
every Union soldier killed in violation of the laws
of war a rebel soldier should be executed; and for
every one enslaved a rebel soldier should be placed
at hard labor on the public works. Happily, however,
little or no action ever became necessary in
pursuance of this order. The Southerners either
did not in fact wreak their vengeance in fulfillment
of their furious vows, or else covered their doings
so that they could not be proved. Only the shocking
incident of the massacre at Fort Pillow seemed
to demand stern retaliatory measures, and even
this was, too mercifully, allowed gradually to sink
away into neglect.<a name='FNanchor_42_42'></a><a href='#Footnote_42_42'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2>BATTLES AND SIEGES: DECEMBER, 1862 &mdash; DECEMBER, 1863</h2>

<p>The clouds of gloom and discouragement, which
shut so heavily about the President in the autumn
of 1862, did not disperse as winter advanced.
That dreary season, when nearly all doubted and
many despaired, is recognized now as an interlude
between the two grand divisions of the drama.
Before it, the Northern people had been enthusiastic,
united, and hopeful; after it, they saw
assurance of success within reach of a reasonable
persistence. But while the miserable days were
passing, men could not see into the mysterious
future. Not only were armies beaten, but the
people themselves seemed to be deserting their
principles. The face and the form of the solitary
man, whose position brought every part of this
sad prospect fully within the range of his contemplation,
showed the wear of the times. The eyes
went deeper into their caverns, and seemed to
send their search farther than ever away into a
receding distance; the furrows sank far into the
sallow face; a stoop bent the shoulders, as if the
burden of the soul had even a physical weight.
<!-- Image No 151 --><a name='Png151'></a><a name='Page135'></a><span class="pagenum">135</span>Yet still he sought neither counsel, nor strength,
nor sympathy from any one; neither leaned on any
friend, nor gave his confidence to any adviser; the
problems were his and the duty was his, and he
accepted both wholly. &quot;I need success more than
I need sympathy,&quot; he said; for it was the cause,
not his own burden, which absorbed his thoughts.
The extremists, who seemed to have more than
half forgotten to hate the South in the intensity of
their hatred of McClellan, had apparently cherished
a vague faith that, if this procrastinating
spirit could be exorcised, the war might then be
trusted to take care of itself. But after they had
accomplished their purpose they were confronted
by facts which showed that in this matter, as in
that of emancipation, the President's deliberation
was not the unpardonable misdoing which they had
conceived it to be. In spite of McClellan's insolent
arrogance and fault-finding, his unreasonable
demands, and his tedious squandering of invaluable
time, Mr. Lincoln, being by nature a man
who contemplated the consequence of an action,
did not desire to make a vacancy till he could fill it
with a better man. &quot;I certainly have been dissatisfied,&quot;
he said, &quot;with Buell and McClellan; but
before I relieved them I had great fears I should
not find successors to them who would do better;
and I am sorry to add I have seen little since
to relieve those fears.&quot; One bloody and costly
experiment had already failed at Manassas. Two
others were soon to result even more disastrously;
<!-- Image No 152 --><a name='Png152'></a><a name='Page136'></a><span class="pagenum">136</span>and still another leader was to be superseded,
before the &quot;man of destiny&quot; came. McClellan had
thrown away superb opportunities; but to turn
him out was not to fill his place with an abler man.</p>

<p>On the evening of November 7, 1862, the dispatch
came which relieved McClellan and put
Burnside in command. The moment was not well
chosen. McClellan seemed in an unusually energetic
temper. He had Lee's army divided, and
was conceivably on the verge of fighting it in detail.<a name='FNanchor_43_43'></a><a href='#Footnote_43_43'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
On the other hand, Burnside assumed the
charge with reluctance and self-distrust. A handsome,
popular gentleman, of pleasing manners and
with the prestige of some easily won successes, he
had the misfortune to be too highly esteemed.</p>

<p>The change of commanders brought a change
of scheme, which was now to advance upon Richmond
by way of Fredericksburg. When this was
submitted to the President he said that it might
succeed if the movement was rapid, otherwise not.
The half of this opinion which concerned success
was never tested; the other half was made painfully
good. Instead of rapidity there was great
delay, with the result that the early days of December
found Lee intrenching strongly upon the
heights behind Fredericksburg on the south bank
of the Rappahannock, having his army now reunited
and reinforced to the formidable strength
of 78,288 men &quot;present for duty.&quot; Burnside lay
upon the north bank, with 113,000 men, but having
<!-- Image No 153 --><a name='Png153'></a><a name='Page137'></a><span class="pagenum">137</span>exchanged the promising advantages which had
existed when he took command for very serious
disadvantages. He had the burden of attacking a
position which he had allowed his enemy not only
to select but to fortify. Happily it is not our task
to describe the cruel and sanguinary thirteenth
day of December, 1862, when he undertook this
desperate task. When that night fell at the
close of a fearful combat, which had been rather a
series of blunders than an intelligent plan, 10,208
Federal soldiers were known to be lying killed or
wounded, while 2145 more were &quot;missing.&quot; Such
was the awful price which the brave Northern
army had paid, and by which it had bought&mdash;nothing!
Nothing, save the knowledge that General
Burnside's estimate of his capacity for such
high command was correct. Even the mere brutal
comparison of &quot;killed and wounded&quot; showed that
among the Confederates the number of men who
had been hit was not quite half that of the Federal
loss. The familiar principle, that in war a general
should so contrive as to do the maximum of injury
to his adversary with a minimum of injury to himself,
had been directly reversed; the unfortunate
commander had done the maximum of injury to
himself with the minimum of injury to his foe.</p>

<p>The behavior of Burnside in so bitter a trial was
such as to attract sympathy. Yet his army had
lost confidence in his leadership, and therefore
suffered dangerously in morale. Many officers
whispered their opinions in Washington, and, as
<!-- Image No 154 --><a name='Png154'></a><a name='Page138'></a><span class="pagenum">138</span>usual, Congress gave symptoms of a desire to talk.
Influenced by these criticisms and menacings, on
December 30 the President ordered Burnside not
to enter again upon active operations without first
informing him. Burnside, much surprised, hastened
to see Mr. Lincoln, and learned what derogatory
strictures were in circulation. After brief
consideration he proposed to resign. But Mr.
Lincoln said: &quot;I do not yet see how I could profit
by changing the command of the army of the Potomac;
and, if I did, I should not wish to do it by accepting
the resignation of your commission.&quot; So
Burnside undertook further manoeuvres. These,
however, did not turn out well, and he conceived
that a contributing cause lay in the half-heartedness
of some of his subordinates. Thereupon he
designed against them a defensive or retaliatory
move in the shape of an order dismissing from the
service of the United States four generals, and
relieving from command four others, and one
colonel. This wholesale decapitation was startling,
yet was, in fact, soundly conceived. In the situation,
either the general, or those who had lost faith
in the general, must go. Which it should be was
conclusively settled by the length of the list of condemned.
The President declined to ratify this,
and Burnside's resignation inevitably followed.
His successor was the general whose name led the
list of those malcontent critics whom he had desired
to displace, and was also the same who had once
stigmatized McClellan as &quot;a baby.&quot; Major-General
<!-- Image No 155 --><a name='Png155'></a><a name='Page139'></a><span class="pagenum">139</span>
Joseph Hooker, a graduate of West Point,
was now given the opportunity to prove his own
superiority.</p>

<p>The new commander was popularly known as
&quot;Fighting Joe.&quot; There was inspiration in the
nickname, and yet it was not quite thus that a
great commander, charged with weighty responsibility,
should be appropriately described. Upon
making the appointment, January 26, 1863, the
President wrote a letter remarkable in many points
of view:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p>&quot;GENERAL,&mdash;I have placed you at the head
of the army of the Potomac. Of course, I have
done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient
reasons; and yet I think it best for you to know
that there are some things in regard to which I
am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to
be a brave and skillful soldier,&mdash;which, of course,
I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with
your profession,&mdash;in which you are right. You
have confidence in yourself,&mdash;which is a valuable,
if not an indispensable quality. You are ambitious,&mdash;which,
within reasonable bounds, does
good rather than harm; but I think that, during
General Burnside's command of the army, you
have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted
him as much as you could, in which you did a
great wrong to the country, and to a most meritorious
and honorable brother officer. I have heard,
in such way as to believe it, of your recently saying
<!-- Image No 156 --><a name='Png156'></a><a name='Page140'></a><span class="pagenum">140</span>
that both the army and the government needed
a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in
spite of it, that I have given you the command.
Only those generals who gain successes can set up
as dictators. What I now ask of you is military
success, and I will risk the dictatorship. The
government will support you to the utmost of its
ability,&mdash;which is neither more nor less than it
has done and will do for all commanders. I
much fear that the spirit which you have aided
to infuse into the army, of criticising their commander
and withholding confidence from him, will
now turn upon you. I shall assist you as far as
I can to put it down. Neither you nor Napoleon,
if he were alive again, could get any good out of
an army while such a spirit prevails in it. And
now, beware of rashness. Beware of rashness,
but, with energy and sleepless vigilance, go forward
and give us victories.&quot;</p>

<br />

<p>Hooker was of that class of generals who show
such capacity as lieutenants that they are supposed
to be capable of becoming independent chiefs,
until their true measure is ascertained by actual
trial. In two months he had restored to good
shape an army which he had found demoralized
and depleted by absenteeism, and at the end of
April he had under him about 124,500 men. He
still lay on the north bank of the Potomac, facing
Lee's army in its intrenchments about Fredericksburg.
His plan of campaign, says General Doubleday,
<!-- Image No 157 --><a name='Png157'></a><a name='Page141'></a><span class="pagenum">141</span>
was &quot;simple, efficacious, and should have
been successful.&quot; Diverting the attention of Lee,
he threw the chief part of his army across the Rappahannock
several miles above Fredericksburg;
then, marching rapidly to Chancellorsville, he
threatened the left flank and rear of the Confederates.
Pushing a short distance out upon the three
roads which led from Chancellorsville to Fredericksburg,
he came to the very edge and brink, as
it were, of beginning a great battle with good promise
of success. But just at this point his generals
at the front were astounded by orders to draw
back to Chancellorsville. Was it that he suddenly
lost nerve in the crisis of his great responsibility?<a name='FNanchor_44_44'></a><a href='#Footnote_44_44'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
Or was it possible that he did not appreciate the
opportunity which he was throwing away? No
one can say. Only the fact can be stated that he
rejected the chance which offended Fortune never
offers a second time. Back came the advanced columns,
and took position at Chancellorsville, while
Lee, who had not the Northern habit of repudiating
fair opportunity, pressed close upon them.</p>

<p>On May 1 manoeuvring for position and some
fighting took place. On Saturday, May 2, a brilliant
flanking movement by &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson
wrecked the Federal right. But the dangerous
Southerner, accidentally shot by his own soldiers,
was carried from the field a dying man. Upon
Sunday, May 3, there was a most sanguinary conflict.
<!-- Image No 158 --><a name='Png158'></a><a name='Page142'></a><span class="pagenum">142</span>
&quot;The Federals fought like devils at Chancellorsville,&quot;
said Mahone. Still it was again the
sad and wearisome story of brave men so badly
handled that their gallantry meant only their own
slaughter. The President had expressly urged
Hooker to be sure to get all his troops at work.
Yet he actually let 37,000 of them stand all day
idle, not firing a shot, while their comrades were
fighting and falling and getting beaten. On May
4, Hooker, whose previous &quot;collapse&quot; had been
aggravated by a severe personal hurt, &quot;seemed disposed
to be inactive;&quot; and Lee seized the chance
to turn upon Sedgwick, who was coming up in the
rear of the Confederates, and to drive him across
the river. General Hooker now made up his mind
that he had been beaten; and though a majority
of his corps commanders were otherwise minded
and were for renewing the conflict, he returned to
the northern bank, leaving behind him his wounded
soldiers, 14 guns, and 20,000 stand of arms. Another
ghastly price had been paid to settle another
experiment and establish the value of another
general. The North lost in killed and wounded
12,197 men, with 5000 others &quot;missing,&quot; and
found out that General Hooker was not the man
to beat General Lee. The Confederate loss was
10,266 killed and wounded, 2753 missing.</p>

<p>The days in which the news from Chancellorsville
was spreading among the cities and villages of
the North were the darkest of the war. In those
countless households, by whose generous contributions
<!-- Image No 159 --><a name='Png159'></a><a name='Page143'></a><span class="pagenum">143</span>
the armies had been recruited, the talk began
to be that it was folly, and even cruelty, to send
brave and patriotic citizens to be slaughtered uselessly,
while one leader after another showed his
helpless incompetence. The disloyal Copperheads
became more bodeful than ever before; while men
who would have hanged a Copperhead as gladly
as they would have shot a Secessionist felt their
hearts sink before the undeniable Southern prestige.
But the truth was that Pope and Burnside
and Hooker, by their very defeats, became the
cause of victory; for the elated Southerners, beginning
to believe that their armies were invincible,
now clamored for &quot;invasion&quot; and the capture
of Washington. Apparently General Lee, too,
had drunk the poison of triumph, and dreamed
of occupying the national capital, Baltimore, and
Philadelphia, and dictating the terms of peace to
a disheartened North. The fascinating scheme&mdash;the
irretrievable and fatal blunder&mdash;was determined
upon.</p>

<p>To carry out this plan Swell's corps was covertly
moved early in June into the Shenandoah Valley.
Hooker, anticipating some such scheme, had suggested
to Mr. Lincoln that, if it were entered
upon, he should like to cross the river and attack
the Southern rear corps in Fredericksburg. The
President suggested that the intrenched Southerners
would be likely to worst the assailants, while
the main Southern army &quot;would in some way be
getting an advantage northward.&quot; &quot;In one word,&quot;
<!-- Image No 160 --><a name='Png160'></a><a name='Page144'></a><span class="pagenum">144</span>he wrote, &quot;I would not take any risk of being
entangled upon the river, like an ox jumped half
over a fence and liable to be torn by dogs front
and rear, without a fair chance to gore one way or
kick the other.&quot; Yet, very soon, when the attenuation
of Lee's line became certain, Lincoln sent
to Hooker one of his famous dispatches: &quot;If the
head of Lee's army is at Martinsburg, and the tail
of it on the plank road between Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville, the animal must be very slim
somewhere. Could you not break him?&quot; But the
&quot;animal&quot; was moving rapidly, and the breaking
process did not take place.</p>

<p>Hooker now conceived a plan seductive by its
audacity and its possible results. He proposed by
a sudden movement to capture Richmond, presumably
garrisoned very scantily, and to get back before
Lee could make any serious impression at the
North. It <i>might</i> have been done, and, if done, it
would more than offset all the dreary past; yet
the risk was great, and Mr. Lincoln could not
sanction it. He wrote: &quot;I think Lee's army, and
not Richmond, is your sure objective point. If
he comes towards the Upper Potomac, follow on
his flank and on his inside track, shortening your
lines while he lengthens his; fight him, too, when
opportunity offers. If he stays where he is, <i>fret
him, and fret him</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>This was good strategy and was adopted for the
campaign. Ewell's corps crossed the Upper Potomac,
and on June 22 was in Pennsylvania. The
<!-- Image No 161 --><a name='Png161'></a><a name='Page145'></a><span class="pagenum">145</span>corps of Longstreet and Hill quickly followed, and
Lee's triumphant army, at least 70,000 strong,
marched through the Cumberland Valley to Chambersburg
and Carlisle, gathering rich booty of
herds and grain as they went, with Harrisburg as
an immediate objective, Philadelphia in no remote
distance, Baltimore and Washington in a painfully
distinct background. The farmers of western
Pennsylvania, startled by the spectacle of gray-coated
cavalry riding northward towards their
state capital, cumbered the roads with their wagons.
The President called from the nearest States
120,000 militia. General Hooker, released from
his waiting attitude by the development of his adversary's
plan, manoeuvred well. He crossed the
Potomac at Edwards' Ferry, June 25-26, and
drew his forces together at Frederick. It was
then decided to move northward and to keep Lee
as well to the westward as possible, thereby reserving,
for the bearing of future events, the questions
of cutting the Confederate communications or
bringing on a battle.</p>

<p>An unfortunate element in these critical days
was that Halleck and Hooker disliked each other,
and that their ideas often clashed. Mr. Lincoln
was at last obliged to say to Hooker: &quot;To remove
all misunderstanding, I now place you in
the strict military relation to General Halleck of
a commander of one of the armies to the general-in-chief
of all the armies. I have not intended
differently; but as it seems to be differently understood,
<!-- Image No 162 --><a name='Png162'></a><a name='Page146'></a><span class="pagenum">146</span>
I shall direct him to give you orders, and
you to obey them.&quot; At the same time he wrote
him a &quot;private&quot; letter, endeavoring to allay the
ill-feeling. He closed it with words of kindness,
of modesty, and with one of his noble appeals for
subjection of personal irritation and for union of
effort on behalf of the country:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you are aware that, since you took
command of the army, I have not believed you had
any chance to effect anything till now. As it looks
to me, Lee's now returning towards Harper's
Ferry gives you back the chance that I thought
McClellan lost last fall. Quite possibly I was
wrong both then and now; but, in the great responsibility
resting upon me, I cannot be entirely
silent. Now, all I ask is that you will be in such
mood that we can get into our action the best cordial
judgment of yourself and General Halleck,
with my poor mite added, if, indeed, he and you
shall think it entitled to any consideration at all.&quot;</p>

<p>The breach, however, could not be closed.
Hooker, finding his army seriously weakened by
the withdrawal of the two years' and the nine
months' troops, asked for the garrison of Harper's
Ferry, which seemed useless where it was. Halleck
refused it, and, June 27, Hooker requested
to be relieved of the command. His request was
instantly granted, and Major-General George G.
Meade was appointed in his place. Swinton says
that command was given to Meade &quot;without any
lets or hindrances, the President expressly waiving
<!-- Image No 163 --><a name='Png163'></a><a name='Page147'></a><span class="pagenum">147</span>all the powers of the executive and the Constitution,
so as to enable General Meade to make,
untrammeled, the best dispositions for the emergency.&quot;
One would like to know the authority
upon which so extraordinary a statement is based;
probably it is a great exaggeration, and the simple
fact would prove to be that, since the situation was
such that new developments were likely to occur
with much suddenness, the President wisely and
even necessarily placed the general in full control,
free from requirements of communication and
consultation. But to represent that Mr. Lincoln
abdicated his constitutional functions is absurd!
Be this as it may, the fact is that the appointment
brought no change of plan. For three days
the armies manoeuvred and drew slowly together.
Finally it was betwixt chance and choice that the
place and hour of concussion were determined.
The place was the village of Gettysburg, and the
time was the morning of July 1.</p>

<p>Then ensued a famous and most bloody fight!
During three long, hot days of midsummer those
two great armies struggled in a desperate grapple,
and with not unequal valor, the Confederates
fiercely assailing, the Federals stubbornly holding,
those historic ridges, and both alike, whether attacking
or defending, whether gaining or losing
ground, always falling in an awful carnage of dead
and wounded. It was the most determined fighting
that had yet taken place at the East, and the
names of Cemetery Ridge, Little Round Top, and
<!-- Image No 164 --><a name='Png164'></a><a name='Page148'></a><span class="pagenum">148</span>Culp's Hill are written deep in blood in American
memories. When the last magnificent charge of
the Southerners was hurled back in the afternoon
of July 3, the victory was decided. The next day
Lee began to send away his trains, his wounded
and prisoners. It is indeed true that during the
day he held his army in position on Seminary
Ridge, hoping that Meade would attack, and that,
with an exchange of their relative parts of assailants
and defenders, a change of result also might
come about. But Meade made no advance, and
with the first hours of darkness on the evening of
July 4 the Southern host began its retreat.</p>

<p>The losses at Gettysburg were appalling. The
estimate is 2834 killed, 13,709 wounded, 6643
missing, a total of 23,186 on the Federal side; the
figures were only a trifle less on the Confederate
side. But if such bloodshed carried grief into
many a Northern household, at least there was not
the cruel thought that life and limb, health and
usefulness, had been sacrificed through incompetence
and without advantage to the cause. It was
true that the Northern general ought to have won,
for he commanded more troops,<a name='FNanchor_45_45'></a><a href='#Footnote_45_45'><sup>[45]</sup></a> held a very strong
defensive position, and fought a strictly defensive
battle. But such had been the history of the war
<!-- Image No 165 --><a name='Png165'></a><a name='Page149'></a><span class="pagenum">149</span>that when that which <i>ought</i> to be done <i>was</i> done,
the people felt that it was fair cause for rejoicing.
Later there was fault-finding and criticism; but
that during so many days so many troops on unfamiliar
ground should be handled in such a manner
that afterward no critic can suggest that something
might have been done better, hardly falls
among possibilities. The fact was sufficient that
a most important and significant victory had been
won. On the battlefield a stone now undertakes
to mark the spot and to name the hour where and
when the flood tide of rebellion reached its highest
point, and where and when it began its slow and
sure ebb. Substantially that stone tells the truth.
Nevertheless the immediately succeeding days
brought keen, counteracting disappointment. Expectation
rose that the shattered army of Lee would
never cross the Potomac; and the expectation was
entirely reasonable, and ought to have been fulfilled.
But Meade seemed to copy McClellan after
Antietam. Spurred on by repeated admonitions
from the President and General Halleck, he did,
on July 10, catch up with the retreating army,
which was delayed at Williamsport on the north
bank of the river by the unusually high water.
He camped close by it, and received strenuous telegrams
urging him to attack. But he did not,<a name='FNanchor_46_46'></a><a href='#Footnote_46_46'><sup>[46]</sup></a> and
<!-- Image No 166 --><a name='Png166'></a><a name='Page150'></a><span class="pagenum">150</span>on the night of July 13 the Southern general successfully
placed the Potomac between himself and
his too tardy pursuer. Bitter then was the resentment
of every loyal man at the North. For once
the President became severe and sent a dispatch of
such tenor that General Meade replied by an offer
to resign his command. This Mr. Lincoln did not
accept. Yet he was too sorely pained not to give
vent to words which in fact if not in form conveyed
severe censure. He was also displeased because
Meade, in general orders, spoke of &quot;driving the invaders
from our soil;&quot; as if the whole country was
not &quot;<i>our soil</i>&quot;! Under the influence of so much
provocation, he wrote to General Meade a letter
reproduced from the manuscript by Messrs. Nicolay
and Hay. It is true that on cooler reflection
he refrained from sending this missive, but it is in
itself sufficiently interesting to deserve reading:&mdash;&quot;I
have just seen your dispatch to General Halleck,
asking to be relieved of your command because
of a supposed censure of mine. I am very
grateful to you for the magnificent success you
gave the cause of the country at Gettysburg; and I
am sorry now to be the author of the slightest pain
to you. But I was in such deep distress myself
that I could not restrain some expression of it. I
have been oppressed nearly ever since the battle of
Gettysburg by what appeared to be evidences that
yourself and General Couch and General Smith
were not seeking a collision with the enemy, but
were trying to get him across the river without
<!-- Image No 167 --><a name='Png167'></a><a name='Page151'></a><span class="pagenum">151</span>another battle. What these evidences were, if you
please, I hope to tell you at some time when we
shall both feel better. The case, summarily stated,
is this: You fought and beat the enemy at Gettysburg;
and, of course, to say the least, his loss was
as great as yours. He retreated; and you did not,
as it seemed to me, pressingly pursue him; but
a flood in the river detained him till, by slow degrees,
you were again upon him. You had at least
twenty thousand veteran troops directly with you,
and as many more raw ones within supporting
distance, all in addition to those who fought with
you at Gettysburg, while it was not possible that
he had received a single recruit; and yet you stood
and let the flood run down, bridges be built, and
the enemy move away at his leisure without attacking
him. And Couch and Smith,&mdash;the latter left
Carlisle in time, upon all ordinary calculation, to
have aided you in the last battle at Gettysburg,
but he did not arrive. At the end of more than
ten days, I believe twelve, under constant urging,
he reached Hagerstown from Carlisle, which is not
an inch over fifty-five miles, if so much; and
Couch's movement was very little different.</p>

<p>&quot;Again, my dear general, I do not believe you
appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved
in Lee's escape. He was within your easy
grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection
with our other late successes, have ended
the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely.
If you could not safely attack Lee last
<!-- Image No 168 --><a name='Png168'></a><a name='Page152'></a><span class="pagenum">152</span>Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the
river, when you can take with you very few more
than two thirds of the force you then had in hand?
It would be unreasonable to expect, and I do not
expect [that] you can now effect much. Your
golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed
immeasurably because of it.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg you will not consider this a prosecution
or persecution of yourself. As you had learned
that I was dissatisfied, I have thought it best to
kindly tell you why.&quot;</p>

<p>There was an odd coincidence during this momentous
first week in July. During the preceding
winter Mr. Lincoln had been exceedingly bothered
by certain Democrats, notably that gentleman of
unsavory repute, Fernando Wood, who had urged
upon him all sorts of foolish schemes for &quot;compromising&quot;
or &quot;settling the difficulties,&quot;&mdash;phrases
which were euphemisms of the peace Democracy
to disguise a concession of success to the South.
The President endured these sterile suggestions
with his wonted patience. But toward the close of
June, Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of
the Confederacy, was seized with the notion that,
if he should go to Washington on a personal mission
to Mr. Lincoln, purporting to be about prisoners
of war, he might then &quot;indirectly ... turn
attention to a general adjustment.&quot; Accordingly
he set forth on his way to Fortress Monroe; but
very inopportunely for his purposes it fell out that
<!-- Image No 169 --><a name='Png169'></a><a name='Page153'></a><span class="pagenum">153</span>the days of his journey were the very days in which
General Lee was getting so roughly worsted at
Gettysburg. So it happened that it was precisely
on the day of the Southern retreat, July 4, that
he notified the admiral in Hampton Roads that he
was the &quot;bearer of a communication in writing
from Jefferson Davis, commander-in-chief of the
land and naval forces of the Confederate States, to
Abraham Lincoln, commander-in-chief of the land
and naval forces of the United States;&quot; and he
asked for leave to proceed to Washington. But
his ingenious phraseology was of no avail. Mr.
Lincoln said: &quot;The request of A.H. Stephens is
inadmissible. The customary agents and channels
are adequate for all needful communication and
conference between the United States forces and
the insurgents.&quot; Thus the shrewd instinct of the
Northerner brought to naught a scheme conceived
in the spirit of the old-time Southern politics, a
scheme which was certainly clever, but which,
without undue severity, may also be called a little
artful and insidious; for Mr. Stephens himself
afterward confessed that it had, for its ulterior
purpose, &quot;not so much to act upon Mr. Lincoln
and the then ruling authorities at Washington as
through them, when the correspondence should be
published, upon the great mass of the people in
the Northern States.&quot; The notion, disseminated
among the people, that Mr. Lincoln would not
listen to proposals for peace, would greatly help
malcontents of the Fernando Wood school.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 170 --><a name='Png170'></a><a name='Page154'></a><span class="pagenum">154</span>
It is necessary now to turn from the Eastern
field of operations to the Middle and Western
parts of the country, where, however, the control
exercised by Mr. Lincoln was far less constant than
at the East. After the series of successes which
culminated at Corinth, the Federal good fortune
rested as if to recuperate for a while. A large
part of the powerful army there gathered was carried
away by Buell, and was soon given occupation
by General Bragg. For Jefferson Davis had long
chosen to fancy that Kentucky was held in an
unwilling subjection to the Union, and from this
thralldom he now designed to relieve her, and to
make the Ohio River the frontier of Secession.
Accordingly cavalry raids in considerable force
were made, Cincinnati was threatened, and General
Bragg, with a powerful army, started northward
from Gainesville. At the same time the
Federals left Murfreesboro', and the two armies
raced for Louisville. Bragg, with a handsome
start, should have won, but on September 29,
1862, Buell entered the city ahead. The winning
of the goal, however, was not the end. Two hostile
armies, which had come so far and got so close
together, were bound to have a fight. This took
place at Perryville, October 8, with the result that
on the next day Bragg began a rapid retreat. He
had brought 20,000 stand of arms for the Kentuckians
who were to flock to his camp; but they
had not flocked, and the theory of Kentuckian disloyalty
was no longer tenable.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 171 --><a name='Png171'></a><a name='Page155'></a><span class="pagenum">155</span>
So soon as Bragg was out of Kentucky, Halleck,
probably at the instigation of the President,
recurred to the project of a campaign in Eastern
Tennessee. Buell said that it was not feasible,
and since by this opinion he placed himself at odds
with the authorities at Washington, he asked to
be relieved from his command. At the close of
October, Major-General William S. Rosecrans
succeeded him. But the new commander would
not, any more than his predecessor, fall in with
Halleck's schemes, and what Cist contemptuously
describes as &quot;Halleck's brilliant paper campaign
into East Tennessee&quot; did not take place.</p>

<p>General Rosecrans took command of the army
at Bowling Green, November 2, 1862. Bragg fell
back to Murfreesboro', in Tennessee, and the city
of Nashville, now in Federal possession, became
the gage of battle. On December 26 Rosecrans
moved out from that city towards Murfreesboro',
and on January 2, 1863, the battle of Stone's
River took place. It was desperately contested,
and the losses were heavy. At the close of the
day the advantage rested with the Confederates;
but it was inconsiderable, and both sides considered
the battle only begun. On the next day, however,
Bragg found such dangerous demoralization
among his troops that he decided to withdraw.
Although he always persisted in describing himself
as the victor in the engagement, yet he now left
his wounded in the hospitals, and fell back to
Shelbyville. In these positions, not far apart, the
<!-- Image No 172 --><a name='Png172'></a><a name='Page156'></a><span class="pagenum">156</span>two armies lay for a long while watching each
other; there were a few raids and small encounters,
but substantially, during the first six months of
1863, quietude reigned in the region which they
dominated.</p>

<p>But quietude was not what the government
wished, and Mr. Lincoln and General Halleck
soon fell into much the same relationship with
Rosecrans which they had previously occupied
towards McClellan. Whenever Rosecrans had
taken the field he had shown himself a skillful
strategist and an able commander in battle; but
his propensity seemed to be to remain in quarters,
and thence to present extravagant exactions, and
to conduct endless disputes with the President and
the general-in-chief. He seemed like a restive
horse, the more he was whipped and spurred the
more immovably he retained his balking attitude.
Mr. Lincoln was sorely tried by this obstinacy,
and probably had been pushed nearly to the limits
of his patience, when at last Rosecrans stirred. It
was on June 24 that he set his army in motion to
settle with Bragg those conclusions which had been
left open for half a year. With this purpose he
moved upon Shelbyville, but when he arrived there
he found that Bragg had gone back to Tullahoma;
and when he pushed on to Tullahoma, Bragg had
left there also. Thus it came to pass that on the
same famous Fourth of July on which Lee started
to get out of Pennsylvania, Bragg in like manner
was getting over the southern boundary line of
<!-- Image No 173 --><a name='Png173'></a><a name='Page157'></a><span class="pagenum">157</span>Tennessee and putting the mountain range between
himself and the pursuing Federal commander.
The converging lines of Federal good luck came
together on this great day of the nation, in a
way that touches the superstitious chord; for still
farther west another and a momentous event was
taking place.</p>

<p>General Grant, at Corinth, had been pondering
a great scheme which he meant to undertake so
soon as his scanty army should be sufficiently reinforced.
If Richmond had an artificial value as a
token of final triumph, the Mississippi River had
scarcely less value of a practical character. Vicksburg
and Port Hudson cut out a mid-section of
about 200 miles of the great stream, which section
still remained under Confederate control. Vicksburg
was General Grant's objective point. Even
to conceive the capture of this stronghold seemed
in itself evidence of genius; no mere pedant in
warfare could have had the conception. Every
difficulty lay in the way of the assailant. The
Confederates had spared no skill, no labor, no
expense in fortifying the town; yet after all had
been done that military science could do, human
achievement counted for little in comparison with
the surpassing arrangements of Nature. If what
she intended could be inferred from what she
had done, she clearly had designed this town to be
through all time a veritable &quot;virgin fortress;&quot; she
had made for its resting-place a great bluff, which
jutted insolently out into the channel of the Mississippi
<!-- Image No 174 --><a name='Png174'></a><a name='Page158'></a><span class="pagenum">158</span>
River, and upon the summit of which the
cluster of buildings resembled rather an eyrie of
eagles than a place of human habitation; the great
stream, as if confounded by the daring obstruction,
before it could recover its interrupted course
spread itself far over the surrounding country in
a tangle of bayous and a vast expanse of unwholesome,
impassable swamp; the high ridges which
lay inland around the place were intersected by
frequent long, deep, and precipitous ravines, so
that by this side also hostile approach had apparently
been rendered impossible. Nevertheless,
that one of the Northern generals to whom nothing
ever seemed impossible, having cast the eye of desire
upon this especial spot, now advanced upon it,
and began operations in his silent, enduring, pertinacious
way, which no men and no intrenchments
could permanently withstand. His lieutenant,
Sherman, made one desperate assault,&mdash;not, as it
seemed, because there was a possibility of taking
the place, but rather to demonstrate that it could
not be taken. Then slower and more toilsome
methods were tried. It was obvious that a siege
must be resorted to; yet it was not easy to get
near enough even to establish a siege.</p>

<p>General Grant had early decided that the city
would remain impregnable until by some means he
could get below it on the river and approach it
from the landward side. Ingenious schemes of
canals were tried, and failed. Time passed; the
month of April was closing, and all that had been
<!-- Image No 175 --><a name='Png175'></a><a name='Page159'></a><span class="pagenum">159</span>done seemed to amount to nothing better than an
accumulation of evidence that the Confederacy had
one spot which the Federals could never touch.
At last ingenuity was laid aside for sheer daring.
The fleet, under Admiral Porter, transported the
army down-stream, athwart the hostile batteries,
and set it ashore on the east bank, below the fortifications.
Yet this very success seemed only to
add peril to difficulty. The Confederates, straining
every nerve to save the place, were gathering a
great force in the neighborhood to break up the
besieging army. With a base of supplies which
was substantially useless, in a hostile country,
with a powerful army hovering near him, and an
unapproachable citadel as his objective, Grant
could save himself from destruction only by complete
and prompt success. Desperate, indeed, was
the occasion, yet all its exorbitant requirements
were met fully, surely, and swiftly by the commander
and the gallant troops under him. In the
task of getting a clear space, by driving the Confederates
from the neighborhood for a considerable
distance around, the army penetrated eastward
as far as Jackson, fighting constantly and living
off the country. Then, returning westward, they
began the siege, which, amid hardship and peril
and infinite difficulty, was pushed with the relentless
vigor of the most relentless and most vigorous
leader of the war. At last, on July 3, General
Pemberton, commanding within the city, opened
negotiations for a surrender. He knew that an
<!-- Image No 176 --><a name='Png176'></a><a name='Page160'></a><span class="pagenum">160</span>assault would be made the next day, and he knew
that it must succeed; he did not want to illustrate
the Fourth of July by so terrible a Confederate
loss, so magnificent a Federal gain. Yet he haggled
over the terms, and by this delay brought
about a part of that which he had wished to avoid.
It was due to his fretfulness about details, that
the day on which the Southern army marched out
and stacked their arms before the fortifications
of Vicksburg, and on which the Northern army,
having generously watched the operation without
a cheer, then marched in and took possession of
the place, was that same Fourth of July on which
two other defeated generals were escaping from
two other victorious Northern armies.</p>

<p>In a military point of view this campaign and
siege have been pronounced by many competent
critics the greatest achievement of the war; but
the magnificent and interesting story must, with
regret, be yielded to the biographer of Grant; it
does not belong to the biographer of Lincoln.
The whole enterprise was committed to Grant to
be handled by him without let or hindrance, and
it was conducted by him from beginning to end
without interference, and almost even without suggestion.
Yet this very fact was greatly to the
credit of the administration. In the outset the
President passed judgment upon the man; and it
was a correct judgment. Afterward he stood to
it gallantly. In the middle of the business, when
the earlier expedients went wrong, a great outcry
<!-- Image No 177 --><a name='Png177'></a><a name='Page161'></a><span class="pagenum">161</span>against Grant arose. Editors and politicians, even
the secretary of the treasury himself, began to
hound the President with importunate demands
for the displacement of a general whom they fervently
alleged to be another of the incompetents;
in short, there was the beginning of just such a
crusade as that which had been made against McClellan.
But by this time the President had had
opportunity to measure the military capacity of
editors and politicians, and he was not now so
much disquieted by their clamor as he once had
been. He simply, in his quiet way, paid no attention
to them whatsoever. Only when one of them
reiterated the gossip about Grant being drunk at
Shiloh, he made his famous reply, that he should
like to send to some other generals a barrel of the
whiskey which Grant drank. In a word, the detractors
of the silent general made little impression
on the solitary President, who told them shortly
and decisively: &quot;I can't spare this man; he
fights.&quot; They wholly failed to penetrate the protecting
fence which the civilian threw around the
soldier, and within the shelter of which that soldier
so admirably performed the feat which more than
any other illustrates the national arms. Certainly
the President comes in for his peculiar share of the
praise. When the news came to Mr. Lincoln he
wrote to General Grant this letter:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p>&quot;July 16, 1863.</p>

<p>&quot;My DEAR GENERAL,&mdash;I do not remember
that you and I ever met personally. I write this
<!-- Image No 178 --><a name='Png178'></a><a name='Page162'></a><span class="pagenum">162</span>now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost
inestimable services you have done the country.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to say a word further. When you
reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you
should do what you finally did,&mdash;march the troops
across the neck, run the batteries with the transports,
and thus go below; and I never had any
faith, except in a general hope that you knew better
than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition and the
like would succeed.</p>

<p>&quot;When you got below and took Port Gibson,
Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should
go down the river and join General Banks; and
when you turned northward, east of the Big Black,
I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make a
personal acknowledgment that you were right and
I was wrong.&quot;</p>

<br />

<p>Immediately after the ceremony of surrender was
over Sherman marched away with a strong force
to find and fight Johnston's army. But that general,
shunning the conflict, moved so far southward
into Mississippi that pursuit was imprudent
during the hot season.</p>

<p>While Grant was finishing the siege of Vicksburg,
General Banks was besieging Port Hudson,
which lay at the southern end of the rebel section
of the river. The fall of the northern post rendered
the southern one untenable, and it was surrendered
on July 9. Henceforth the great river
was a safe roadway for unarmed craft flying the
stars and stripes.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 179 --><a name='Png179'></a><a name='Page163'></a><span class="pagenum">163</span>
It is time now to go back to Tennessee. By the
close of the first week in July, 1863, the Confederate
force was established in Chattanooga, and
thus the hostile armies were &quot;placed back in the
relative positions occupied by them prior to Bragg's
advance into Kentucky, a little less than one year
previous.&quot; But though the Southern general had
reached his present position by a retreat at the
end of a disappointing enterprise, the issue of final
success was still an open one between him and
Rosecrans, with many advantages on his side.
He had a large army in the heart of a mountainous
region, with the opportunity to post it in
positions which ought to be impregnable. Moreover,
he received fresh troops under Johnston;
and later the inaction of Meade in Virginia encouraged
Lee to send to him a considerable force under
Longstreet, himself no small reinforcement. These
arrived just on the eve of the impending battle.</p>

<p>Meantime Mr. Lincoln was sorely exercised at
his inability to make his generals carry out his
plans. He desired that Burnside should move
down from the north and unite with Rosecrans,
and that then the combined force should attack
Bragg promptly. But Rosecrans lay still for
about six weeks, to repair losses and fatigue, and
again played the part of the restive steed, responding
to the President's spur only with fractious
kickings. It was August 16 when he moved, but
then he showed his usual ability in action. The
march was difficult; yet, on September 6, he had
<!-- Image No 180 --><a name='Png180'></a><a name='Page164'></a><span class="pagenum">164</span>his whole force across the Tennessee and in the
mountains south of Chattanooga. Burnside, meanwhile,
had advanced to Knoxville, but had stopped
there, and was now, greatly to Mr. Lincoln's bewilderment
and annoyance, showing activity in
every direction except precisely that in which he
was directed to move.</p>

<p>At last, after much fruitless manoeuvring, the
collision took place, and for two days there was
fierce and stubborn fighting on the famous battlefield
of Chickamauga. On the second day, September
20, Longstreet, commanding the Confederate
left, thoroughly defeated the Federal right and
centre and sent them in precipitate flight to Chattanooga.
Rosecrans, overwhelmed amid the rush
of fugitives, and thinking that all was lost, also
hastened thither to take charge of the fragments.
In truth all would have been lost, had it not been
for Thomas. This able and resolute commander
won in this fight the rhetorical but well merited
name of &quot;the Rock of Chickamauga.&quot; Under him
the Federal left stood immovable, though furiously
assailed by odds, and tried by the rout of their
comrades. At nightfall these troops, still in position,
covered the withdrawal to Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Rosecrans, badly demoralized, gave the President
to understand that there had been a terrible
disaster, and the President, according to his custom
in such trying moments, responded with words
of encouragement and an instant effort to restore
morale. Mr. Lincoln always cheered his generals
<!-- Image No 181 --><a name='Png181'></a><a name='Page165'></a><span class="pagenum">165</span>in the hour of disaster, which he seemed to regard
only as the starting-point for a new advance, the
incentive to a fresh exertion. Yet, in fact, there
had not been a disaster, but only a moderate
worsting of the Federal army, resulting in its
retirement a trifling distance to the place whence
its opponents had just marched out. The issue
between the two generals was still as open after
Rosecrans's misfortune as it had been after the
previous misfortunes of Bragg. Already there
was a new question, who would win that coming
battle which plainly was close at hand. The curtain
had only gone down on an act; the drama itself
had not been played out.</p>

<p>Bragg advanced to besiege Chattanooga, and
Rosecrans's communications were so imperfect
that his troops were put on short rations. On the
other hand, Mr. Lincoln bestirred himself vigorously.
He promptly sent Sherman from the West,
and Hooker from the East, each with considerable
reinforcements, en route for the beleaguered town.
Also he saw plainly that, whether by fault or misfortune,
the usefulness of Rosecrans was over, and
on October 16 he put Thomas in place of Rosecrans,<a name='FNanchor_47_47'></a><a href='#Footnote_47_47'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
and gave to General Grant the command
of the Military Division of the Mississippi, including
the Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland,
and the Tennessee. Grant at once telegraphed
to Thomas to hold Chattanooga at all hazards; to
<!-- Image No 182 --><a name='Png182'></a><a name='Page166'></a><span class="pagenum">166</span>which Thomas replied: &quot;We will hold the town
till we starve!&quot; Grant well knew that they were
already getting very hungry. He showed his usual
prompt energy in relieving them; and a little
fighting soon opened a route by which sufficient
food came into the place.</p>

<p>It was now obvious that the decisive conflict
between the two armies, which had so long been
striving for the advantage of strategic position,
and fighting in hostile competition, was at last
to occur. Each had its distinctive advantage.
The Federals were led by Grant, with Sherman,
Thomas, Sheridan, and Hooker as his lieutenants,&mdash;a
list which may fairly recall Napoleon and his
marshals. On the other hand, the Southerners,
lying secure in intrenched positions upon the precipitous
sides and lofty summits of Lookout Mountain
and Missionary Ridge, seemed invulnerably
placed. It does not belong to this narrative to
describe the terrific contest in which these two
combatants furiously locked horns on November
24 and 25. It was Hooker's brave soldiers who
performed the conspicuous feat which was conclusive
of victory. Having, by command, stormed
the first line of rifle-pits on the ascent, upon the
Confederate left, they suddenly took the control
into their own hands; without orders they dashed
forward, clambered upward in a sudden and
resistless access of fighting fury, and in an hour,
emerging above the mists which shrouded the
mid-mountain from the anxious view of General
<!-- Image No 183 --><a name='Png183'></a><a name='Page167'></a><span class="pagenum">167</span>Grant, they planted the stars and stripes on top
of Lookout Mountain. They had fought and won
what was poetically christened &quot;the battle above
the clouds.&quot; Sherman, with seven divisions, had
meanwhile been making desperate and bloody
assaults upon Missionary Ridge, and had gained
the first hilltop; but the next one seemed impregnable.
It was, however, not necessary for him to
renew the costly assault; for Hooker's victory,
which was quickly followed by a handsome advance
by Sheridan, on Sherman's right, so turned the
Confederate position as to make it untenable.</p>

<p>The Northerners were exasperated to find,
among the Confederate troops who surrendered as
captives in these two battles, prisoners of war
taken at Vicksburg and Port Hudson, who had
been paroled and never exchanged.</p>

<p>On the eve of this battle Longstreet had started
northward to cut off and destroy Burnside in
Knoxville, and no sooner was the actual fighting
over than Grant sent Sherman in all haste to
Burnside's assistance. Thereupon Longstreet fell
back towards Virginia, and came to a resting-place
midway, where he afterward lay unharmed and
unharming for many months. Thus at last the
long-deferred wish of the President was fulfilled,
and the chief part of East Tennessee was wrested
from Confederate occupation. Among the loyal
inhabitants the great rejoicing was in proportion
to the sufferings which they had so long been
undergoing.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 184 --><a name='Png184'></a><a name='Page168'></a><span class="pagenum">168</span>
Meanwhile, since Gettysburg, no conspicuous
event had attracted attention in Virginia. The
President had been disappointed that Meade had
not fought at Williamsport, but soon afterward he
gave decisive advice against forcing a fight at a
worse place in order to cure the blunder of having
let go the chance to fight at the right place.
About the middle of September, however, when
Lee had reduced his army by leaves of absence
and by dispatching Longstreet to reinforce Bragg,
Mr. Lincoln thought it a good time to attack him.
Meade, on the other hand, now said that he did
not feel strong enough to assault, and this although
he had 90,000 men &quot;between him and Washington,&quot;
and by his estimate the whole force of the
enemy, &quot;stretching as far as Richmond,&quot; was only
60,000. &quot;For a battle, then,&quot; wrote Mr. Lincoln,
&quot;General Meade has three men to General Lee's
two. Yet, it having been determined that choosing
ground and standing on the defensive gives so
great advantage that the three cannot safely attack
the two, the three are left simply standing on the
defensive also. If the enemy's 60,000 are sufficient
to keep our 90,000 away from Richmond,
why, by the same rule, may not 40,000 of ours
keep their 60,000 away from Washington, leaving
us 50,000 to put to some other use?... I can
perceive no fault in this statement, unless we admit
we are not the equal of the enemy man for man.&quot;
But when, a few days later, Stanton proposed to
detach 30,000 men from Meade to Rosecrans, Mr.
<!-- Image No 185 --><a name='Png185'></a><a name='Page169'></a><span class="pagenum">169</span>Lincoln demurred, and would agree only to let go
13,000, whom Hooker took with him to Chattanooga.
Probably he did not wish to diminish the
Federal strength in Virginia.</p>

<p>Late in October, Lee, overestimating the number
of troops thus withdrawn, endeavored to move
northward; but Meade outmanoeuvred and outmarched
him, and he fell back behind the Rapidan.
General Meade next took his turn at the
aggressive. Toward the close of November he
crossed the Rapidan with the design of flanking
and attacking Lee. But an untoward delay gave
the Southerners time to intrench themselves so
strongly that an attack was imprudent, and Meade
returned to the north bank of the stream. The
miscarriage hurt his reputation with the people,
though he was not to blame for it.</p>

<p>Now, as the severe season was about to begin,
all the armies both of the North and of the South,
on both sides of the mountain ranges, turned gladly
into winter quarters. Each had equal need to rest
and recuperate after hard campaigns and bloody
battles. For a while the war news was infrequent
and insignificant; and the cessation in the thunder
of cannon and the rattle of musketry gives opportunity
again to hear the voices of contending politicians.
For a while we must leave the warriors
and give ear to the talkers.</p>

But, says Swinton, there was less disproportion than usual;

had been greatly reduced, both by casualties and by the expiration
of terms of service. On May 13 he reported that his &quot;marching

<a name='CHAPTER_VI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2>SUNDRIES</h2>

<p>It has been pleasant to emerge from the dismal
winter of 1862-63 into the sun-gleam of the Fourth
of July of the latter year. But it is necessary to
return for a while into that dusky gloom, for the
career of a &quot;war president&quot; is by no means wholly
a series of campaigns. Domestic politics, foreign
relations, finance, make their several demands.</p>

<p>Concerning one of these topics, at least, there is
little to be said. One day, in a period of financial
stress, Mr. Chase expressed a wish to introduce to
the President a delegation of bankers, who had
come to Washington to discuss the existing condition
with regard to money. &quot;Money!&quot; exclaimed
Mr. Lincoln, &quot;I don't know anything about
'money'! I never had enough of my own to fret
me, and I have no opinion about it any way.&quot;
Accordingly, throughout his administration he left
the whole subject in the hands of the secretary
of the treasury. The tariffs and internal revenue
bills, the legal tender notes, the &quot;five-twenties,&quot;
the &quot;ten-forties,&quot; and the &quot;seven-thirties,&quot; all the
loans, the national banking system, in short, all
the financial schemes of the administration were
<!-- Image No 187 --><a name='Png187'></a><a name='Page171'></a><span class="pagenum">171</span>adopted by Mr. Lincoln upon the recommendation
of Mr. Chase, with little apparent study upon his
own part. Satisfied of the ability of his secretary,
he gave to all the Treasury measures his loyal support.
In return, he expected the necessary funds
to be forthcoming; for he had implicit confidence
in the willingness of the people to pay the bills of
the Union; and he expected the secretary to arrange
methods by which they could do so with reasonable
convenience. Mr. Chase was cast for the
role of magician, familiar with those incantations
which could keep the Treasury ever full. It was
well thus, for in fact no word or incident in Mr.
Lincoln's life indicates that he had any capacity
whatsoever in financiering. To live within his income
and pay his dues with a minute and careful
punctuality made the limit of his dealings and his
interest in money matters.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Foreign affairs, less technical, could not in like
easy manner be committed to others, and in these
Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward labored together.
The blackest cloud was the Trent affair, yet after
that had passed the sky by no means became clear.
In the spring of 1862 the Oreto went out from
Liverpool to become the rebel privateer Florida.
Before her departure Mr. Adams complained concerning
her to the English government, but was
assured that the vessel was designed for the Sicilian
fruit trade! As it is not diplomatic to say that
gentlemen in office are telling lies, the American
<!-- Image No 188 --><a name='Png188'></a><a name='Page172'></a><span class="pagenum">172</span>minister could push the matter no farther. The
Florida, therefore, escaped, not to conduct commerce
with Sicily, but to destroy the commerce of
the United States. At the same time that she was
fitting out, a mysterious craft, oddly known only
as the &quot;290,&quot; was also building in the Liverpool
docks, and against her Mr. Adams got such evidence
that the queen's ministers could not help deciding
that she must be detained. Unfortunately,
however, and by a strange, if not a significant
chance, they reached this decision on the day after
she had sailed! She became the notorious Alabama.
Earl Russell admitted that the affair was
&quot;a scandal,&quot; but this did not interfere with the
career of Captain Semmes. In these incidents
there was both cause and provocation for war, and
hot-headed ones cried out for it, while prudent men
feared it. But the President and the secretary
were under the bonds of necessity to keep their
official temper. Just at this juncture England
would have found it not only very easy, but also
very congenial to her real sympathies, to play for
the South a part like that which France had once
played for certain thirteen revolted colonies, and
thereby to change a rebellion into a revolution.
So Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward, not willing to
give the unfriendly power this opportunity, only
wrote down in the national ledger sundry charges
against Great Britain, which were afterward paid,
not promptly, yet in full!</p>

<p>Another provoking thing was the placing of</p>

<p><!-- Image No 189 --><a name='Png189'></a><a name='Page173'></a><span class="pagenum">173</span>
Confederate loans in London. This could not be
interfered with. The only comfort was that the
blockaded South had much difficulty in laying
hands upon the proceeds of the bonds which English
friends of the Slave Empire were induced to
buy. Yet time, always the faithful auxiliary of
the North, took care of this matter also. When
the news of Gettysburg and Vicksburg came, the
investors, who had scarcely finished writing the
cheques with which to pay their subscriptions,
were obliged to face a drop of thirty per cent, in
the market price of their new securities. For
many years after the war was over British strong
boxes wasted space in accommodating these absurd
documents, while the idea of their worthlessness
was slowly filtering through the minds of their
owners.</p>

<p>Another thing, which did no harm at all, but
was exceedingly vexatious, was the constant suggestion
of European mediation. For a couple of
years, at least, the air was full of this sort of talk.
Once, in spite of abundant discouragement, the
French emperor actually committed the folly of
making the proposal. It came inopportunely on
February 3, 1863, after the defeat of Fredericksburg,
like a carrion bird after a battle. It was
rejected very decisively, and if Napoleon III. appreciated
Mr. Seward's dispatch, he became aware
that he had shown gross lack of discernment. Yet
he was not without some remarkable companions
in this incapacity to understand that which he was
<!-- Image No 190 --><a name='Png190'></a><a name='Page174'></a><span class="pagenum">174</span>observing, as if from aloft, with an air of superior
wisdom. One would think that the condition of
feeling in the United States which had induced
Governor Hicks, in the early stage of the rebellion,
to suggest a reference to Lord Lyons, as arbitrator,
had long since gone by. But it had not;
and it is the surprising truth that Horace Greeley
had lately written to M. Mercier, the French minister
at Washington, suggesting precisely the step
which the emperor took; and there were other less
conspicuous citizens who manifested a similar lack
of spirit and intelligence.</p>

<p>All this, however, was really of no serious consequence.
Talk about mediation coming from
American citizens could do little actual injury, and
from foreigners it could do none. If the foreigners
had only been induced to offer it by reason of
a friendly desire to help the country in its hour of
stress, the rejection might even have been accompanied
with sincere thanks. Unfortunately, however,
it never came in this guise; but, on the contrary,
it always involved the offensive assumption
that the North could never restore the integrity of
the Union by force. Northern failure was established
in advance, and was the unconcealed, if not
quite the avowed, basis of the whole transaction.
Now though mere unfriendliness, not overstepping
the requirements of international law, could inflict
little substantial hurt, yet there was something
very discouraging in the unanimity and positiveness
with which all these experienced European
<!-- Image No 191 --><a name='Png191'></a><a name='Page175'></a><span class="pagenum">175</span>statesmen assumed the success of the Confederacy
as the absolutely sure outcome; and in this time
of extreme trial to discourage was to injure. Furthermore,
the undisguised pleasure with which this
prospect was contemplated was sorely trying to
men oppressed by the burdens of anxiety and trouble
which rested on the President and his ministers.
The man who had begun life as a frontiersman
had need of much moral courage to sustain
him in the face of the presagings, the condemnations,
and the hostility of nearly all the sage and
well-trained statesmen of Europe. In those days
the United States had not yet fully thrown off a
certain thralldom of awe before European opinion.
Nevertheless, at whatever cost in the coin
of self-reliance, the President and the secretary
maintained the courage of their opinions, and
never swerved or hesitated in the face of foreign
antipathy or contempt. The treatment inflicted
upon them was only so much added to the weight
under which they had to stand up.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Rebellion and foreign ill-will, even Copperheadism,
presented difficulties and opposition which
were in a certain sense legitimate; but that loyal
Republicans should sow the path of the administration
thick with annoyances certainly did seem
an unfair trial. Yet, on sundry occasions, some
of which have been mentioned, these men did this
thing, and they did it in the very uncompromising
and exasperating manner which is the natural
<!-- Image No 192 --><a name='Png192'></a><a name='Page176'></a><span class="pagenum">176</span>emanation from conscientious purpose and intense
self-faith. An instance occurred in December,
1862. The blacker the prospect became, the
more bitter waxed the extremists. Such is the
fashion of fanatics, who are wont to grow more
warm as their chances seem to grow more desperate;
and some of the leaders of the anti-slavery
wing of the Republican party were fanatics.
These men by no means confined their hostility to
the Democratic McClellan; but extended it to so
old and tried a Republican as the secretary of state
himself. It had already come to this, that the
new party was composed of, if not split into, two
sections of widely discordant views. The conservative
body found its notions expressed in the
cabinet by Seward; the radical body had a mouthpiece
in Chase. The conservatives were not aggressive;
but the radicals waged a genuine political
warfare, and denounced Seward, not, indeed, with
the vehemence which was considered to be appropriate
against McClellan, yet very strenuously.
Finally this hostility reached such a pass that, at
a caucus of Republican senators, it was actually
voted to demand the dismission of this long-tried
and distinguished leader in the anti-slavery struggle.
Later, in place of this blunt vote, a more
polite equivalent was substituted, in the shape of
a request for a reconstruction of the cabinet.
Then a committee visited the President and pressed
him to have done with the secretary, whom they
thought lukewarm. Meanwhile, Seward had heard
<!-- Image No 193 --><a name='Png193'></a><a name='Page177'></a><span class="pagenum">177</span>of what was going forward, and, in order to free
Mr. Lincoln from embarrassment, he had already
tendered his resignation before the committee arrived.</p>

<p>The crisis was serious. The recent elections
indicated that even while, as now, the government
represented all the sections of Republicanism,
still the situation was none too good; but if it
was to be controlled by the extremist wing of a
discordant party, the chance that it could endure
to the end the tremendous strain of civil war was
reduced almost to hopelessness. The visitors who
brought this unwelcome suggestion to the President
received no immediate response or expression
of opinion from him, but were invited to come
again in the evening; they did so, and were then
much surprised to meet all the members of the
cabinet except Mr. Seward. An outspoken discussion
ensued, in which Mr. Chase found his position
embarrassing, if not equivocal. On the following
morning, he, with other members of the cabinet,
came again for further talk with the President; in
his hand he held a written resignation of his office.
He &quot;tendered&quot; it, yet &quot;did not advance to deliver
it,&quot; whereupon the President stepped forward and
took it &quot;with alacrity.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_48_48'></a><a href='#Footnote_48_48'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p>Having now in his hands the resignations of the
chiefs of the two principal factions of the party,
the President had made the first step towards relieving
<!-- Image No 194 --><a name='Png194'></a><a name='Page178'></a><span class="pagenum">178</span>
the situation of dangerous one-sidedness.
At once he took the next step by sending to each
this note:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p>December 20, 1862.</p>

<p>HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD and HON. SALMON P. CHASE:</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>,&mdash;You have respectively tendered
me your resignations as secretary of state and secretary
of the treasury of the United States. I am
apprised of the circumstances which render this
course personally desirable to each of you; but,
after most anxious consideration, my deliberate
judgment is, that the public interest does not admit
of it.</p>

<p>I therefore have to request that you will resume
the duties of your departments respectively.</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

<br />

<p>The next morning Mr. Seward wrote briefly:
&quot;I have cheerfully resumed the functions of this
department, in obedience to your command.&quot; Mr.
Chase seemed to hesitate. On December 20, in the
afternoon, he had written a letter, in which he had
said that he thought it desirable that his resignation
should be accepted. He gave as his reason
that recent events had &quot;too rudely jostled the
unity&quot; of the cabinet; and he intimated that, with
both himself and Seward out of it, an improved
condition might be reached. He had not, however,
actually dispatched this, when the President's
<!-- Image No 195 --><a name='Png195'></a><a name='Page179'></a><span class="pagenum">179</span>
note reached him. He then, though feeling
his convictions strengthened, decided to hold back
the letter which he had prepared and &quot;to sleep
on&quot; the matter. Having slept, he wrote, on the
morning of December 22, a different letter, to the
effect that, though reflection had not much, if at
all, changed his original opinion as to the desirability
of his resignation, yet he would conform to
the judgment and wishes of the President. If Mr.
Chase was less gracious than Mr. Seward in this
business, it is to be remembered that he was very
much more dissatisfied with the President's course
than was Mr. Seward, who, indeed, for the most
part was not dissatisfied at all.</p>

<p>Thus a dangerous crisis was escaped rather than
overcome. For though after the relief given by
this plain speaking the situation did not again
become quite so strained as it had previously been,
yet disagreement between men naturally prudent
and men naturally extremist was inevitable. Nevertheless
it was something that the two sections
had encountered each other, and that neither had
won control of the government. The President
had restrained dissension within safe limits and
had saved himself from the real or apparent domination
of a faction. When it was all over, he
said: &quot;Now I can ride; I have got a pumpkin in
each end of my bag.&quot; Later on he repeated: &quot;I
do not see how it could have been done better. I
am sure it was right. If I had yielded to that
storm and dismissed Seward, the thing would all
<!-- Image No 196 --><a name='Png196'></a><a name='Page180'></a><span class="pagenum">180</span>have slumped over one way, and we should have
been left with a scanty handful of supporters.&quot;
Undoubtedly he had managed very skillfully a very
difficult affair, but he ought never to have been
compelled to arrange such quarrels in the camp of
his own party.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Those counties of Virginia which lay west of
the Alleghanies contained a population which was,
by an overwhelming majority, strenuously loyal.
There had long been more of antagonism than of
friendship between them and the rest of the State,
and now, as has been already mentioned, the secession
of Virginia from the Union stimulated
them, in turn, to secede from Virginia. In the
summer of 1861 they took measures to form themselves
into a separate State; and in April, 1862,
they adopted a state Constitution by a vote of
18,862 yeas against 514 nays. A bill for the admission
of &quot;West Virginia&quot; was passed by the
Senate in July, and by the House in December,
and was laid before the President for signature.
There were nice questions of constitutional law
about this, and some doubt also as to whether the
move was altogether well advised. Mr. Lincoln
asked the opinions of the cabinet as to whether he
should sign the bill. Three said Yea, and three
Nay; and it was noteworthy that the three who
thought it expedient also thought it constitutional,
and that the three who thought it inexpedient also
thought it unconstitutional. Mr. Lincoln, not
<!-- Image No 197 --><a name='Png197'></a><a name='Page181'></a><span class="pagenum">181</span>much assisted, then decided in the affirmative, and
signed the bill December 31, 1862. A statement
of the reasons<a name='FNanchor_49_49'></a><a href='#Footnote_49_49'><sup>[49]</sup></a> which led him to this decision concludes
thus: &quot;It is said that the admission of West
Virginia is secession, and tolerated only because
it is <i>our</i> secession. Well, if we call it by that
name, there is still difference enough between secession
against the Constitution and secession in
favor of the Constitution.&quot; Mr. Elaine says that
the creation of this State was sustained by &quot;legal
fictions;&quot; and Thaddeus Stevens declared that it
was a measure entirely outside of any provision of
the Constitution, yet said that he should vote for
it in accordance with his general principle: that
none of the States in rebellion were entitled to the
protection of the Constitution. The Republicans
themselves were divided in their views as to the
lawfulness of the measure. However the law
may have stood, it is evident to us, looking backward,
that for practical purposes the wisdom of
the President's judgment cannot be impugned.
The measure was the amputation of so much territory
from that which the Confederates, if they
should succeed, could claim as their own; and it
produced no inconvenience at all when, instead of
succeeding, they failed.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Many causes conspired to induce an obstreperous
outbreak of &quot;Copperheadism&quot; in the spring of
1863. The Democratic successes in the elections
<!-- Image No 198 --><a name='Png198'></a><a name='Page182'></a><span class="pagenum">182</span>of the preceding autumn were in part a premonition
of this, in part also a cause. Moreover,
reaction was inevitable after the intense outburst
of patriotic enthusiasm which had occurred during
the earlier part of the war. But more than all
this, Mr. Lincoln wrote, and every one knew,
that, &quot;if the war fails, the administration fails,&quot;
and thus far the war had been a failure. So the
grumblers, the malcontents, and the Southern sympathizers
argued that the administration also, at
least so far as it had gone, had been a failure; and
they fondly conceived that their day of triumph
was dawning.</p>

<p>That which was due, punctually arrived. There
now came into prominence those secret societies
which, under a shifting variety of names, continued
to scheme and to menace until the near and
visible end of the war effected their death by inanition.
The Knights of the Golden Circle, The
Order of American Knights, the Order of the
Star, The Sons of Liberty, in turn enlisted recruits
in an abundance which is now remembered
with surprise and humiliation,&mdash;sensations felt
perhaps most keenly by the sons of those who
themselves belonged to the organizations. Mr.
Seward well said: &quot;These persons will be trying
to forget, years hence, that they ever opposed this
war.&quot; These societies gave expression to a terrible
blunder, for Copperheadism was even more
stupid than it was vicious. But the fact of their
stupidity made them harmless. Their very names
<!-- Image No 199 --><a name='Png199'></a><a name='Page183'></a><span class="pagenum">183</span>labeled them. Men who like to enroll themselves
in Golden Circles and in Star galaxies seldom
accomplish much in exacting, especially in dangerous,
practical affairs. Mr. Lincoln took this
sensible view of these associations. His secretaries,
who doubtless speak from personal knowledge,
say that his attitude &quot;was one of good-humored
contempt.&quot;</p>

<p>As a rule these &quot;Knights&quot; showed their valor
in the way of mischief, plotting bold things, but
never doing them. They encouraged soldiers to
desert; occasionally they assassinated an enrolling
officer; they maintained communications with the
Confederates, to whom they gave information and
occasionally also material aid; they were tireless
in caucus work and wire-pulling; in Indiana, in
1863, they got sufficient control of the legislature
to embarrass Governor Morton quite seriously;
they talked much about establishing a Northwestern
Confederacy; a few of them were perhaps
willing to aid in those cowardly efforts at incendiarism
in the great Northern cities, also in
the poisoning of reservoirs, in the distribution of
clothing infected with disease, and in other like
villainies which were arranged by Confederate emissaries
in Canada, and some of which were imperfectly
carried out in New York and elsewhere;
they also made great plans for an uprising and for
the release of Confederate prisoners in Ohio, Illinois,
and Indiana. But no actual outbreak ever
occurred; for when they had come close to the
<!-- Image No 200 --><a name='Png200'></a><a name='Page184'></a><span class="pagenum">184</span>danger line, these associates of mediaeval tastes
and poetic appellatives always stopped short.</p>

<p>The President was often urged to take decisive
measures against these devisers of ignoble treasons.
Such men as Governor Morton and General Rosecrans
strove to alarm him. But he said that the
&quot;conspiracy merited no special attention, being
about an equal mixture of puerility and malice.&quot;
He had perfect information as to all the doings
and plottings, and as to the membership, of all
the societies, and was able to measure accurately
their real power of hurtfulness; he never could be
induced to treat them with a severity which was
abundantly deserved, but which might not have
been politic and would certainly have added to the
labor, the expense, and the complications of the
government. &quot;Nothing can make me believe,&quot; he
once charitably said, &quot;that one hundred thousand
Indiana Democrats are disloyal!&quot; His judgment
was proved to be sound; for had many of these
men been in grim earnest in their disloyalty, they
would have achieved something. In fact these
bodies were unquestionably composed of a small
infusion of genuine traitors, combined with a vastly
larger proportion of bombastic fellows who liked
to talk, and foolish people who were tickled in
their shallow fancy by the element of secrecy and
the fineness of the titles.</p>

<p>The man whose name became unfortunately preeminent
for disloyalty at this time was Clement
L. Vallandigham, a Democrat, of Ohio. General
<!-- Image No 201 --><a name='Png201'></a><a name='Page185'></a><span class="pagenum">185</span>Burnside was placed in command of the Department
of the Ohio, March 25, 1863, and having
for the moment no Confederates to deal with, he
turned his attention to the Copperheads, whom he
regarded with even greater animosity. His Order
No. 38, issued on April 13, brought these hornets
about his ears in impetuous fury; for, having made
a long schedule of their favorite offenses, which
he designed for the future severely to proscribe,
he closed it by saying that &quot;the habit of declaring
sympathy for the enemy will not be allowed
in this Department;&quot; and he warned persons with
treasonable tongues that, unless they should keep
that little member in order, they might expect
either to suffer death as traitors, or to be sent
southward within the lines of &quot;their friends.&quot;
Now Mr. Vallandigham had been a member of
Congress since 1856, and was at present a prominent
candidate for any office which the Democrats
of his State or of the United States might be able
to fill; he was the popular and rising leader of the
Copperhead wing of the Democracy. Such was
his position that it would have been ignominious
for him to allow any Union general to put a military
gag in his mouth. Nor did he. On the contrary,
he made speeches which at that time might
well have made Unionists mad with rage, and
which still seem to have gone far beyond the limit
of disloyalty which any government could safely
tolerate. Therefore on May 4 he was arrested by
a company of soldiers, brought to Cincinnati, and
<!-- Image No 202 --><a name='Png202'></a><a name='Page186'></a><span class="pagenum">186</span>thrown into jail. His friends gathered in anger,
and a riot was narrowly avoided. At once, by
order of General Burnside, he was tried by a military
commission. He was charged with &quot;publicly
expressing sympathy for those in arms against the
government of the United States, and declaring
disloyal sentiments and opinions, with the object
and purpose of weakening the power of the government
in its efforts to suppress an unlawful rebellion.&quot;
Specifications were drawn from a speech
delivered by him on or about May 1. The evidence
conclusively sustained the indictment, and
the officers promptly pronounced him guilty, whereupon
he was sentenced by Burnside to confinement
in Fort Warren. An effort to obtain his release
by a writ of habeas corpus was ineffectual.</p>

<p>The rapidity of these proceedings had taken
every one by surprise. But the Democrats throughout
the North, rapidly surveying the situation,
seized the opportunity which perhaps had been
too inconsiderately given them. The country rang
with plausible outcries and high-sounding oratory
concerning military usurpation, violation of the
Constitution, and stifling freedom of speech. It
was painfully obvious that this combination of
rhetoric and argument troubled the minds of many
well-affected persons. If the President had been
consulted in the outset, it is thought by some that
he would not have allowed matters to proceed so
far. Soon afterward, in his reply to the New
York Democrats, he said: &quot;In my own discretion,
<!-- Image No 203 --><a name='Png203'></a><a name='Page187'></a><span class="pagenum">187</span>I do not know whether I would have ordered the
arrest of Mr. Vallandigham.&quot; On the other hand,
Mr. Blaine states that Burnside &quot;undoubtedly had
confidential instructions in regard to the mode of
dealing with the rising tide of disloyalty which,
beginning in Ohio, was sweeping over the West.&quot;</p>

<p>In a very short time the violence of the fault-finding
reached so excessive a measure that Burnside
offered his resignation; but Mr. Lincoln declined
to accept it, saying that, though all the
cabinet regretted the necessity for the arrest,
&quot;some perhaps doubting there was a real necessity
for it, yet, being done, all were for seeing you
through with it.&quot; This seems to have been his
own position. In fact it was clear that, whether
what had been done was or was not a mistake, to
undo it would be a greater mistake. Accordingly
Mr. Lincoln only showed that he felt the pressure
of the criticism and denunciation by commuting the
sentence, and directing that Vallandigham should
be released from confinement and sent within the
Confederate lines,&mdash;which was, indeed, a very
shrewd and clever move, and much better than the
imprisonment. Accordingly the quasi rebel was
tendered to and accepted by a Confederate picket,
on May 25. He protested vehemently, declared
his loyalty, and insisted that his character was that
of a prisoner of war. But the Confederates, who
had no objection whatsoever to his peculiar methods
of demonstrating &quot;loyalty&quot; to their opponents,
insisted upon treating him as a friend, the victim
<!-- Image No 204 --><a name='Png204'></a><a name='Page188'></a><span class="pagenum">188</span>of an enemy common to themselves and him; and
instead of exchanging him as a prisoner, they facilitated
his passage through the blockade on his way
to Canada. There he arrived in safety, and thence
issued sundry manifestoes to the Democracy. On
June 11 the Democratic Convention of Ohio nominated
him as their candidate for governor, and it
seems that for a while they really expected to elect
him.</p>

<p>In the condition of feeling during the months in
which these events were occurring, they undeniably
subjected the government to a very severe strain.
They furnished the Democrats with ammunition
far better than any which they had yet found, and
they certainly used it well. Since the earliest days
of the war there had never been quite an end of
the protestation against arbitrary military arrests
and the suspension of the sacred writ of habeas
corpus, and now the querulous outcry was revived
with startling vehemence. Crowded meetings were
held everywhere; popular orators terrified or enraged
their audiences with pictures of the downfall
of freedom, the jeopardy of every citizen; resolutions
and votes without number expressed the
alarm and anger of the great assemblages; learned
lawyers lent their wisdom to corroborate the rhetoricians,
and even some Republican newspapers
joined the croaking procession of their Democratic
rivals. Erelong the assaults appeared to be producing
effects so serious and widespread that the
President was obliged to enter into the controversy.
<!-- Image No 205 --><a name='Png205'></a><a name='Page189'></a><span class="pagenum">189</span>On May 16 a monster meeting of &quot;the Democrats
of New York&quot; was told by Governor Seymour
that the question was: &quot;whether this war is waged
to put down rebellion at the South, or to destroy
free institutions at the North.&quot; Excited by such
instigation, the audience passed sundry damnatory
resolutions and sent them to the President.</p>

<p>Upon receiving these, Mr. Lincoln felt that he
must come down into the arena, without regard to
official conventionality. On June 12 he replied by
a full presentation of the case, from his point of
view. He had once more to do the same thing
in response to another address of like character
which was sent to him on June 11 by the Democratic
State Convention of Ohio. In both cases
the documents prepared by the remonstrants were
characterized, to more than the usual degree, by
that dignified and <i>ore rotundo</i> phraseology, that
solemnity in the presentation of imposing generalities,
which are wont to be so dear to committees
charged with drafting resolutions. The replies of
the President were in striking contrast to this
rhetorical method alike in substance and in form;
clear, concise, and close-knit, they were models of
good work in political controversy, and like most
of his writing they sorely tempt to liberal transcription,
a temptation which must unfortunately
be resisted, save for a few sentences. The opening
paragraph in the earlier paper was cleverly put:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The resolutions are resolvable into two propositions,&mdash;first,
the expression of a purpose to
<!-- Image No 206 --><a name='Png206'></a><a name='Page190'></a><span class="pagenum">190</span>sustain the cause of the Union, to secure peace
through victory, and to support the administration
in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress
the rebellion; and, secondly, a declaration
of censure upon the administration for supposed
unconstitutional action, such as the making of military
arrests. And, from the two propositions, a
third is deduced, which is, that the gentlemen composing
the meeting are resolved on doing their
part to maintain our common government and
country, despite the folly or wickedness, as they
may conceive, of any administration. This position
is eminently patriotic, and, as such, I thank
the meeting, and congratulate the nation for it.
My own purpose is the same, so that the meeting
and myself have a common object, and can have
no difference, except in the choice of means or
measures for effecting that object.&quot;</p>

<p>Later on followed some famous sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility to the
war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was
made because he was laboring, with some effect,
to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertion
from the army, and to leave the rebellion
without an adequate military force to suppress it.
He was not arrested because he was damaging the
political prospects of the administration or the
personal interests of the commanding general, but
because he was damaging the army, upon the existence
and vigor of which the life of the Nation
depends....</p>

<p><!-- Image No 207 --><a name='Png207'></a><a name='Page191'></a><span class="pagenum">191</span>
&quot;I understand the meeting whose resolutions I am considering to be in favor of suppressing
the rebellion by military force, by armies. Long
experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained
unless desertion shall be punished by the
severe penalty of death.</p>

<p>&quot;The case requires, and the law and the Constitution
sanction, this punishment. Must I shoot
a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, while
I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who
induces him to desert? This is none the less injurious
when effected by getting a father, or brother,
or friend, into a public meeting, and there
working upon his feelings until he is persuaded to
write the soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad
cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptible
government, too weak to arrest and punish
him if he shall desert. I think that, in such a
case, to silence the agitator, and save the boy, is
not only constitutional, but withal a great mercy.&quot;</p>

<p>The Ohio Democrats found themselves confronted
with this:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Your nominee for governor ... is known to
you and to the world to declare against the use
of an army to suppress the rebellion. Your own
attitude therefore encourages desertion, resistance
to the draft, and the like, because it teaches those
who incline to desert and to escape the draft to
believe it is your purpose to protect them, and to
hope that you will become strong enough to do so.&quot;</p>

<p>The arguments of the President called out retort
<!-- Image No 208 --><a name='Png208'></a><a name='Page192'></a><span class="pagenum">192</span>
rather than reply, for in fact they really could not
be answered, and they were too accurately put to
be twisted by sophistry; that they reached the
minds of the people was soon made evident. The
Democratic managers had made a fatal blunder in
arraying the party in a position of extreme hostility
to the war. Though there were at the North
hosts of grumblers who were maliciously pleased
at all embarrassments of the administration, and
who were willing to make the prosecution of the
war very difficult, there were not hosts who were
ready to push difficulty to the point of impossibility.
On the other hand the fight was made very
shrewdly by the Union men of Ohio, who nominated
John Brough, a &quot;war Democrat,&quot; as their
candidate. Then the scales fell from the eyes of
the people; they saw that in real fact votes for
Brough or for Vallandigham were, respectively,
votes for or against the Union. The campaign
became a direct trial of strength on this point.
Freedom of speech, habeas corpus, and the kindred
incidents of the Vallandigham case were laid aside
as not being the genuine and fundamental questions.
It was one of those instances in which the
common sense of the multitude suddenly takes
control, brushes away confusing details, and gets
at the great and true issue. The result was that
Vallandigham was defeated by a majority of over
100,000 votes; and thus a perilous crisis was well
passed. This incident had put the Republican
ascendency in extreme peril, but when the administration
<!-- Image No 209 --><a name='Png209'></a><a name='Page193'></a><span class="pagenum">193</span>
emerged from the trial with a success so
brilliant, it was thereafter much stronger than if
the test had never been made. The strain was one
of that kind to which the war was subjecting the
whole nation, a strain which strengthens rather
than weakens the body which triumphantly encounters
it. The credit for the result was generally
admitted to be chiefly due to Mr. Lincoln's
effective presentation of the Republican position.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>As the second year of the war drew towards its
close, the administration had to face a new and
grave difficulty in the recruitment of the army.
Serious errors which had been made in calling and
enlisting troops now began to bear fruit. Under
the influence of the first enthusiasm a large proportion
of the adult male population at the North
would readily have enlisted &quot;for the war;&quot; but
unfortunately that opportunity had not been seized
by the government, and it soon passed, never to
return. That the President and his advisers had
been blameworthy can hardly be said; but whether
they had been blameworthy or excusable became an
immaterial issue, when they found that the terms
of enlistment were soon to expire, and also that
just when the war was at its hottest, the patriotism
of the people seemed at its coldest. Defeats
in the field and Copperheadism at home combined
in their dispiriting and deadly work. Voluntary
enlistment almost ceased. Thereupon Congress
passed an act &quot;for enrolling and calling out the
<!-- Image No 210 --><a name='Png210'></a><a name='Page194'></a><span class="pagenum">194</span>national forces.&quot; All able-bodied citizens between
twenty and forty-five years of age were to &quot;perform
military duty in the service of the United
States, when called on by the President for that
purpose.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_50_50'></a><a href='#Footnote_50_50'><sup>[50]</sup></a> This was strenuous earnest, for it
portended a draft.</p>

<p>The situation certainly was not to be considered
without solicitude when, in a war which peculiarly
appealed to patriotism, compulsion must be used
to bring involuntary recruits to maintain the contest.
Yet the relaxation of the patriotic temper
was really not so great as this fact might seem to
indicate. Besides many partial and obvious explanations,
one which is less obvious should also be
noted. During two years of war the people, notoriously
of a temperament readily to accept new
facts and to adapt themselves thereto, had become
accustomed to a state of war, and had learned to
regard it as a <i>condition</i>, not normal and permanent,
yet of indefinite duration. Accordingly they
were now of opinion that the government must
charge itself with the management of this condition,
that is to say, with the conduct of the war,
as a strict matter of business, to be carried on like
all other public duties and functions. In the first
months of stress every man had felt called upon
to contribute, personally, his own moral, financial,
and even physical support; but that crisis had
passed, and it was now conceived that the administration
might fairly be required to arrange for
<!-- Image No 211 --><a name='Png211'></a><a name='Page195'></a><span class="pagenum">195</span>getting men and money and supplies in the systematic
and business-like fashion in which, as history
taught, all other governments had been accustomed
to get these necessaries in time of war.</p>

<p>At any rate, however it was to be explained or
commented upon, the fact confronted Mr. Lincoln
that he must institute enrollment and drafting.
The machinery was arranged and the very disagreeable
task was entered upon early in the summer
of 1863. If it was painful in the first instance
for the President to order this, the process was
immediately made as hateful as possible for him.
Even loyal and hearty &quot;war-governors&quot; seemed at
once to accept as their chief object the protection
of the people of their respective States from the
operation of the odious law. The mercantile element
was instantly and fully accepted by them.
The most patriotic did not hesitate to make every
effort to have the assigned quotas reduced; they
drew jealous comparisons to show inequalities; and
they concocted all sorts of schemes for obtaining
credits. Not marshaling recruits in the field, but
filling quotas upon paper, seemed a legitimate purpose;
for the matter had become one of figures, of
business, of competition, and all the shrewdness
of the Yankee mind was at once aroused to gain
for one's self, though at the expense of one's
neighbors. Especially the Democratic officials
were viciously fertile in creating obstacles. The
fact that the Act of Congress was based on the
precedent of an Act of the Confederate Congress,
<!-- Image No 212 --><a name='Png212'></a><a name='Page196'></a><span class="pagenum">196</span>passed a year before, did not seem in the least to
conciliate the Copperheads. Governor Seymour of
New York obtained a discreditable preeminence in
thwarting the administration. He gathered ingenious
statistics, and upon them based charges of dishonest
apportionments and of fraudulent discrimination
against Democratic precincts. He also
declared the statute unconstitutional, and asked the
President to stay all proceedings under it until it
could be passed upon by the Supreme Court of the
United States,&mdash;an ingenuous proposition, which
he neglected to make practicable by arranging
with General Lee to remain conveniently quiescent
while the learned judges should be discussing the
methods of reinforcing the Northern armies.</p>

<p>In a word, Mr. Lincoln was confronted by every
difficulty that Republican inventiveness and Democratic
disaffection could devise. Yet the draft
must go on, or the war must stop. His reasonableness,
his patience, his capacity to endure unfair
trials, received in this business a demonstration
more conspicuous than in any other during his
presidency. Whenever apportionments, dates,
and credits were questioned, he was liberal in making
temporary, and sometimes permanent allowances,
preferring that any error in exactions should
be in the way of moderation. But in the main
business he was inflexible; and at last it came to a
direct issue between himself and the malcontents,
whether the draft should go on or stop. In the
middle of July the mob in New York city tested
<!-- Image No 213 --><a name='Png213'></a><a name='Page197'></a><span class="pagenum">197</span>the question. The drafting began there on Saturday
morning, July 11. On Monday morning, July
13, the famous riot broke out. It was an appalling
storm of rage on the part of the lower classes;
during three days terror and barbarism controlled
the great city, and in its streets countless bloody
and hideous massacres were perpetrated. Negroes
especially were hanged and otherwise slain most
cruelly. The governor was so inefficient that he
was charged, of course extravagantly, with being
secretly in league with the ringleaders. A thousand
or more lives, as it was roughly estimated,
were lost in this mad and brutal fury, before
order was again restored. The government gave
the populace a short time to cool, and then sent
10,000 troops into the city and proceeded with the
business without further interruption. A smaller
outbreak took place in Boston, but was promptly
suppressed. In other places it was threatened,
but did not occur. In spite of all, the President
continued to execute the law. Yet although by
this means the armies might be kept full, the new
men were very inferior to those who had responded
voluntarily to the earlier calls. Every knave in
the country adopted the lucrative and tolerably
safe occupation of &quot;bounty-jumping,&quot; and every
worthless loafer was sent to the front, whence he
escaped at the first opportunity to sell himself
anew and to be counted again. The material of
the army suffered great depreciation, which was
only imperfectly offset by the improvement of the
<!-- Image No 214 --><a name='Png214'></a><a name='Page198'></a><span class="pagenum">198</span>military machine, whereby a more effective discipline,
resembling that of European professionalism,
was enforced.<a name='FNanchor_51_51'></a><a href='#Footnote_51_51'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2>THE TURN OF THE TIDE</h2>


<p>The winter of 1862-63 was for the Rebellion
much what the winter of Valley Forge was for the
Revolution. It passed, however, and the nation
still clung fast to its purpose. The weak brethren
who had become dismayed were many, but the
people as a whole was steadfast. This being so,
ultimate success became assured. Wise and cool-headed
men, in a frame of mind to contemplate the
situation as it really was, saw that the tide was
about at its turning, and that the Union would not
drift away to destruction in this storm at any rate.
They saw that the North <i>could</i> whip the South, if
it chose; and it was now sufficiently evident that
it would choose,&mdash;that it would endure, and would
finish its task. It was only the superficial observers
who were deceived by the Virginian disasters,
which rose so big in the foreground as partially to
conceal the real fact,&mdash;that the Confederacy was
being at once strangled and starved to death. The
waters of the Atlantic Ocean and of the Gulf of
Mexico were being steadily made more and more
inaccessible, as one position after another along the
coast gradually passed into Federal hands. The
<!-- Image No 216 --><a name='Png216'></a><a name='Page200'></a><span class="pagenum">200</span>Mississippi River, at last a Union stream from its
source to its mouth, now made a Chinese wall for
the Confederacy on the west. Upon the north the
line of conflict had been pushed down to the northern
borders of Mississippi and Georgia, and the
superincumbent weight of the vast Northwest lay
with a deadly pressure upon these two States.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, only in Virginia that the Confederates
had held their own, and here, with all
their victories, they had done no more than just
hold their own. They had to recognize, also, that
from such battlefields as Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville
they gathered no sustenance, however
much they might reap in the way of glory. Neither
had they gained even any ground, for the
armies were still manoeuvring along the same roads
over which they had been tramping and swaying
to and fro for more than two years. By degrees
the Southern resources in the way of men, money,
food, and supplies generally, were being depleted.
The Confederacy was like a lake, artificially inclosed,
which was fed by no influx from outside,
while it was tapped and drained at many points.</p>

<p>On the other hand, within the North, affairs
were coming into a more satisfactory condition. It
was true that all the military successes of July
had not discouraged the malcontents; and during
the summer they had been busily preparing for the
various state elections of the autumn, which they
hoped would strongly corroborate their congressional
triumphs of 1862. But when the time came
<!-- Image No 217 --><a name='Png217'></a><a name='Page201'></a><span class="pagenum">201</span>they were exceedingly disappointed. The law now,
fairly enough, permitted soldiers in the field to
vote, and this was, of course, a reinforcement for
the Republican party; but even among the voters
at home the Democratic reaction of the preceding
year had spent its force. In October Pennsylvania
gave Governor Curtin, the Republican
candidate for re&euml;lection, a majority of 15,000.
In the same month, under the circumstances described
in the preceding chapter, Ohio buried Vallandigham
under a hostile majority of more than
100,000. The lead thus given by the &quot;October
States&quot; was followed by the &quot;November States.&quot;
In New York no governor was to be elected; but
the Republican state ticket showed a majority of
30,000, whereas the year before Seymour had
polled a majority of 10,000. The Northwest fell
into the procession, though after a hard fight. A
noteworthy feature of the struggle, which was fierce
and for a time doubtful in Illinois, was a letter
from Mr. Lincoln. He was invited to attend a
mass meeting at Springfield, and with reluctance
felt himself obliged to decline; but in place of a
speech, which might not have been preserved, the
good fortune of posterity caused him to write this
letter:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p>August 26, 1863.</p>

<p>HON. JAMES C. CONKLING:</p>

<p><i>My dear Sir</i>,&mdash;Your letter inviting me to attend
a mass meeting of unconditional Union men,
to be held at the capital of Illinois, on the third
<!-- Image No 218 --><a name='Png218'></a><a name='Page202'></a><span class="pagenum">202</span>day of September, has been received. It would be
very agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends
at my own home, but I cannot just now be absent
from here as long as a visit there would require.</p>

<p>The meeting is to be of all those who maintain
unconditional devotion to the Union, and I am sure
my old political friends will thank me for tendering,
as I do, the nation's gratitude to those other
noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan
hope can make false to the nation's life.</p>

<p>There are those who are dissatisfied with me.
To such I would say: you desire peace, and you
blame me that we do not have it. But how can we
attain it? There are but three conceivable ways:
First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms.
This I am trying to do. Are you for it? If you
are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a
second way is to give up the Union. I am against
this. Are you for it? If you are, you should say
so plainly. If you are not for <i>force</i>, nor yet for
<i>dissolution</i>, there only remains some imaginable
<i>compromise</i>.</p>

<p>I do not believe that any compromise embracing
the maintenance of the Union is now possible. All
that I learn leads to a directly opposite belief.
The strength of the rebellion is its military, its
army. That army dominates all the country and
all the people within its range. Any offer of
terms made by any man or men within that range,
in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for
the present; because such man or men have no
<!-- Image No 219 --><a name='Png219'></a><a name='Page203'></a><span class="pagenum">203</span>power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise,
if one were made with them.</p>

<p>To illustrate: suppose refugees from the South
and peace men of the North get together in convention,
and frame and proclaim a compromise
embracing a restoration of the Union. In what
way can that compromise be used to keep Lee's
army out of Pennsylvania? Meade's army can
keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania, and, I
think, can ultimately drive it out of existence.
But no paper compromise, to which the controllers
of Lee's army are not agreed, can at all affect that
army. In an effort at such compromise we would
[should] waste time, which the enemy would improve
to our disadvantage, and that would be all.</p>

<p>A compromise, to be effective, must be made
either with those who control the rebel army, or
with the people, first liberated from the domination
of that army by the success of our own army.
Now, allow me to assure you that no word or intimation
from that rebel army, or from any of the
men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise,
has ever come to my knowledge or belief.
All charges and insinuations to the contrary are
deceptive and groundless. And I promise you
that if any such proposition shall hereafter come,
it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you.
I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of
the people, according to the bond of service, the
United States Constitution; and that, as such, I
am responsible to them. But to be plain, you are
<!-- Image No 220 --><a name='Png220'></a><a name='Page204'></a><span class="pagenum">204</span>dissatisfied with me about the negro. Quite likely
there is a difference of opinion between you and
myself upon that subject. I certainly wish that
all men could be free, while you, I suppose, do not.
Yet I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure
which is not consistent with even your views,
provided that you are for the Union. I suggested
compensated emancipation, to which you replied:
you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes. But
I had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes,
except in such a way as to save you from greater
taxation to save the Union exclusively by other
means.</p>

<p>You dislike the emancipation proclamation, and
perhaps would have it retracted. You say it is
unconstitutional. I think differently. I think the
Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with
all the law of war in time of war. The most that
can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are property.
Is there, has there ever been, any question
that by the law of war, property, both of enemies
and friends, may be taken when needed? And is
it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the
enemy? Armies, the world over, destroy enemies'
property when they cannot use it, and even destroy
their own to keep it from the enemy.</p>

<p>... But the proclamation, as law, either is valid or
is not valid. If it is not valid it needs no retraction.
If it is valid, it cannot be retracted, any
more than the dead can be brought to life. Some
<!-- Image No 221 --><a name='Png221'></a><a name='Page205'></a><span class="pagenum">205</span>of you profess to think its retraction would operate
favorably for the Union. Why better after the
retraction than before the issue? There was more
than a year and a half of trial to suppress the
rebellion before the proclamation was issued, the
last one hundred days of which passed under an
explicit notice that it was coming, unless averted
by those in revolt returning to their allegiance.
The war has certainly progressed as favorably for
us since the issue of the proclamation as before.
I know, as fully as one can know the opinion of
others, that some of the commanders of our armies
in the field, who have given us our most important
victories, believe the emancipation policy and the
use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blows
yet dealt to the rebellion, and that at least one
of those important successes could not have been
achieved, when it was, but for the aid of black
soldiers.</p>

<p>Among the commanders who hold these views
are some who have never had an affinity with what
is called &quot;abolitionism,&quot; or with &quot;Republican
party politics,&quot; but who hold them purely as military
opinions. I submit their opinions as entitled
to some weight against the objections often urged
that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise
as military measures, and were not adopted
as such in good faith.</p>

<p>You say that you will not fight to free negroes.
Some of them seem willing to fight for you; but
no matter. Fight you, then, exclusively to save
<!-- Image No 222 --><a name='Png222'></a><a name='Page206'></a><span class="pagenum">206</span>the Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose
to aid you in saving the Union. Whenever you
shall have conquered all resistance to the Union,
if I shall urge you to continue fighting it will be
an apt time then for you to declare you will not
fight to free negroes. I thought that, in your
struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the
negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that
extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to
you. Do you think differently?</p>

<p>I thought that whatever negroes can be got to
do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white
soldiers to do in saving the Union. Does it appear
otherwise to you? But negroes, like other people,
act upon motives. Why should they do anything
for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they
stake their lives for us, they must be prompted by
the strongest motive, even the promise of freedom.
And the promise, being made, must be kept.</p>

<p>The signs look better. The Father of Waters
again goes unvexed to the sea. Thanks to the
great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to them.
Three hundred miles up they met New England,
Empire, Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way
right and left. The sunny South, too, in more
colors than one, also lent a helping hand. On the
spot their part of the history was jotted down in
black and white. The job was a great national
one, and let none be slighted who bore an honorable
part in it. And while those who have cleared
the great river may well be proud, even that is not
<!-- Image No 223 --><a name='Png223'></a><a name='Page207'></a><span class="pagenum">207</span>all. It is hard to say that anything has been more
bravely or well done than at Antietam, Murfreesboro',
Gettysburg, and on many fields of less note.
Nor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten. At
all the watery margins they have been present,
not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the
rapid river, but also up the narrow muddy bayou,
and wherever the ground was a little damp, they
have been and made their tracks. Thanks to all.
For the great Republic,&mdash;for the principle it lives
by and keeps alive,&mdash;for man's vast future,&mdash;thanks
to all.</p>

<p>Peace does not appear so distant as it did. I
hope it will come soon, and come to stay, and so
come as to be worth the keeping in all future time.
It will then have been proved that among free men
there can be no successful appeal from the ballot
to the bullet, and that they who take such appeal
are sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And
there will be some black men who can remember
that with silent tongue, and clinched teeth, and
steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have
helped mankind on to this great consummation;
while I fear there will be some white men unable
to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful
speech they have striven to hinder it.</p>

<p>Still, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy final
triumph. Let us be quite sober. Let us diligently
apply the means, never doubting that a just God, in
his own good time, will give us the rightful result.</p>

<p>Yours very truly,</p>

<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

This was a fair statement of past facts and of
the present condition; and thus the plain tokens
of the time showed that the menace of disaffection
had been met and sufficiently conquered. The
President had let the nation see the strength of his
will and the immutability of his purpose. He had
faced bullying Republican politicians, a Democratic
reaction, Copperheadism, and mob violence,
and by none of these had he been in the
least degree shaken or diverted from his course.
On the contrary, from so many and so various
struggles he had come out the victor, a real ruler
of the country. He had shown that whenever and
by whomsoever, and in whatever part of the land
he was pushed to use power, he would use it. Temporarily
the great republic was under a &quot;strong
government,&quot; and Mr. Lincoln was the strength.
Though somewhat cloaked by forms, there was for
a while in the United States a condition of &quot;one-man
power,&quot; and the people instinctively recognized
it, though they would on no account admit
it in plain words. In fact every malcontent knew
that there was no more use in attempting to resist
the American President than in attempting to
resist a French emperor or a Russian czar; there
was even less use, for while the President managed
on one plausible ground or another to have and
to exercise all the power that he needed, he was
sustained by the good-will and confidence of a
majority of the people, which lay as a solid substratum
beneath all the disturbance on the surface.
<!-- Image No 225 --><a name='Png225'></a><a name='Page209'></a><span class="pagenum">209</span>It was well that this was so, for a war conducted
by a cabinet or a congress could have ended only
in disaster. This peculiar character of the situation
may not be readily admitted; it is often convenient
to deny and ignore facts in order to assert
popular theories; and that there was a real <i>master</i>
in the United States is a proposition which many
will consider it highly improper to make and very
patriotic to contradict. None the less, however, it
is true, and by the autumn of 1863 every intelligent
man in the country <i>felt</i> that it was true.
Moreover, it was because this was true, and because
that master was immovably persistent in the
purpose to conquer the South, that the conquest of
the South could now be discerned as substantially
a certainty in the future.</p>

<p>Some other points should also be briefly made
here. The war is to be divided into two stages.
The first two years were educational; subsequently
the fruits of that education were attained. The
men who had studied war as a profession, but had
had no practical experience, found much to learn
in warfare as a reality after the struggle began.
But before the summer of 1863 there were in the
service many generals, than whom none better
could be desired. &quot;Public men&quot; were somewhat
slow in discovering that their capacity to do pretty
much everything did not include the management
of campaigns. But by the summer of 1863 these
&quot;public&quot; persons made less noise in the land
than they had made in the days of McClellan;
<!-- Image No 226 --><a name='Png226'></a><a name='Page210'></a><span class="pagenum">210</span>and though political considerations could never
be wholly suppressed, the question of retaining
or displacing a general no longer divided parties,
or superseded, and threatened to wreck, the vital
question of the war. Moreover, as has been remarked
in another connection, the nation began to
appreciate that while war was a science so far as
the handling of armies in the field was concerned,
it was strictly a business in its other aspects. By,
and in fact before, the summer of 1863 this business
had been learned and was being efficiently
conducted.</p>

<p>Time and experience had done no less for the
President than for others. A careful daily student
of the topography of disputed regions, of every
proposed military movement, of every manoeuvre,
every failure, every success, he was making himself
a skillful judge in the questions of the campaigns.
He had also been studying military literature.
Yet as his knowledge and his judgment grew, his
modesty and his abstention from interference likewise
grew. He was more and more chary of
endeavoring to control his generals. The days of
such contention as had thwarted the plans of McClellan
without causing other plans to be heartily
and fully adopted had fortunately passed, never
to return. Of course, however, this was in part
due to the fact that the war had now been going
on long enough to enable Mr. Lincoln to know
pretty well what measure of confidence he could
place in the several generals. He had tried his
<!-- Image No 227 --><a name='Png227'></a><a name='Page211'></a><span class="pagenum">211</span>experiments and was now using his conclusions.
Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Thomas, Hancock, and
Meade were no longer undiscovered generals; while
Fremont, McClellan, Halleck&mdash;and perhaps two
or three more might be named&mdash;may be described
in a counter-phrase as generals who were now
quite thoroughly discovered. The President and
the country were about to get the advantage of
this acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>A consequence of these changed conditions, of
the entrance upon this new stage of the war, becomes
very visible in the life of Mr. Lincoln. The
disputation, the hurly-burly, the tumultuous competition
of men, opinions, and questions, which
made the first eighteen months of his presidency
confusing and exciting as a great tempest on the
sea, have gone by. For the future his occupation
is rather to keep a broad, general supervision, to
put his controlling touch for the moment now here,
now there. He ceases to appear as an individual
contestant; his personality, though not less important,
is less conspicuous; his influence is exerted
less visibly, though not less powerfully. In short,
the business-like aspect affects him and his functions
as it does all else that concerns the actual
conduct of the war; he too feels, though he may
not formulate, the change whereby a crisis has
passed into a condition. This will be seen from
the character of the remainder of this narrative.
There are no more controversies which call for
other chapters like those which told of the campaigns
<!-- Image No 228 --><a name='Png228'></a><a name='Page212'></a><span class="pagenum">212</span>
of McClellan. There are no more fierce
intestine dissensions like those which preceded
the Proclamation of Emancipation,&mdash;at least not
until the matter of reconstruction comes up, and
reconstruction properly had not to do with the war,
but with the later period. In a word, the country
had become like the steed who has ceased fretfully
to annoy the rider, while the rider, though exercising
an ever-watchful control, makes less apparent
exertion.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>By one of the odd arrangements of our governmental
machine, it was not until December 7,
1863, that the members of the Thirty-eighth Congress
met for the first time to express those political
sentiments which had been in vogue more than
a year before that time, that is to say during the
months of October and November, 1862, when
these gentlemen had been elected, at the close of
the summer's campaign. It has been said and
shown that a very great change in popular feeling
had taken place and made considerable advance
during this interval. The autumn of 1863 was
very different from the autumn of 1862! A Congress
coming more newly from the people would
have been much more Republican in its complexion.
Still, even as it was, the Republicans had an
ample working majority, and moreover were disturbed
by fewer and less serious dissensions among
themselves than had been the case occasionally
in times past. McClellan and the Emancipation
<!-- Image No 229 --><a name='Png229'></a><a name='Page213'></a><span class="pagenum">213</span>Proclamation had not quite yet been succeeded by
any other questions of equal potency for alienating
a large section of the party from the President.
Not that unanimity prevailed by any means; that
was impossible under the conditions of human nature.
The extremists still distrusted Mr. Lincoln,
and regarded him as an obstruction to sound
policies. Senator Chandler of Michigan, a fine
sample of the radical Republican, instructed him
that, by the elections, Conservatives and traitors
had been buried together, and begged him not to
exhume them, since they would &quot;smell worse than
Lazarus did after he had been buried three days.&quot;
Apparently he ranked Seward among these defunct
and decaying Conservatives; certainly he regarded
the secretary as a &quot;millstone about the neck&quot; of
the President.<a name='FNanchor_52_52'></a><a href='#Footnote_52_52'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Still, in spite of such denunciations,
times were not in this respect so bad as they
had been, and the danger that the uncompromising
Radicals would make wreck of the war was no
longer great.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Another event, occurring in this autumn of 1863,
was noteworthy because through it the literature
of our tongue received one of its most distinguished
acquisitions. On November 19 the national military
cemetery at Gettysburg was to be consecrated;
Edward Everett was to deliver the oration, and the
President was of course invited as a guest. Mr.
Arnold says that it was actually while Mr. Lincoln
<!-- Image No 230 --><a name='Png230'></a><a name='Page214'></a><span class="pagenum">214</span>
was &quot;in the cars on his way from the White
House to the battlefield&quot; that he was told that he
also would be expected to say something on the
occasion; that thereupon he jotted down in pencil
the brief address which he delivered a few hours
later.<a name='FNanchor_53_53'></a><a href='#Footnote_53_53'><sup>[53]</sup></a> But that the composition was quite so extemporaneous
seems doubtful, for Messrs. Nicolay
and Hay transcribe the note of invitation, written
to the President on November 2 by the master of
the ceremonies, and in it occurs this sentence: &quot;It
is the desire that, after the oration, you, as Chief
Executive of the Nation, formally set apart these
grounds to their sacred use, by a few appropriate
remarks.&quot; Probably, therefore, some forethought
went to the preparation of this beautiful and
famous &quot;Gettysburg speech.&quot; When Mr. Everett
sat down, the President arose and spoke as follows:<a name='FNanchor_54_54'></a><a href='#Footnote_54_54'><sup>[54]</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers
brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived
in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal. Now we are
engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate
<!-- Image No 231 --><a name='Png231'></a><a name='Page215'></a><span class="pagenum">215</span>
a portion of that field as a final resting-place
for those who here gave their lives that that nation
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this. But in a larger sense we
cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot
hallow, this ground. The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far
above our poor power to add or detract. The
world will little note, nor long remember, what we
say here, but it can never forget what they did
here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated
here to the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
task remaining before us;&mdash;that from these honored
dead, we take increased devotion to that cause
for which they gave the last full measure of devotion;&mdash;that
we here highly resolve that these dead
shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under
God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that
government of the people, by the people, for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2>RECONSTRUCTION</h2>


<p>In his inaugural address President Lincoln said:
&quot;The union of these States is perpetual.... No
State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get
out of the Union; resolves and ordinances to that
effect are legally void.&quot; In these words was imbedded
a principle which later on he showed his
willingness to pursue to its logical conclusions
concerning the reconstruction of the body politic.
If no State, by seceding, had got itself out of the
Union, there was difficulty in maintaining that
those citizens of a seceding State, who had not disqualified
themselves by acts of treason, were not
still lawfully entitled to conduct the public business
and to hold the usual elections for national and
state officials, so soon as the removal of hostile
force should render it physically possible for them
to do so. Upon the basis of this principle, the
resumption by such citizens of a right which had
never been lost, but only temporarily interfered
with by lawless violence, could reasonably be delayed
by the national government only until the
loyal voters should be sufficient in number to
relieve the elections from the objection of being
<!-- Image No 233 --><a name='Png233'></a><a name='Page217'></a><span class="pagenum">217</span>colorable and unreal. This philosophy of &quot;reconstruction&quot;
seemed to Mr. Lincoln to conform
with law and good sense, and he was forward in
meeting, promoting, almost even in creating opportunities
to apply it. From the beginning of
the war he had been of opinion that the framework
of a state government, though it might be scarcely
more than a skeleton, was worth preservation. It
held at least the seed of life. So after West Virginia
was admitted into statehood, the organization
which had been previously established by the loyal
citizens of the original State was maintained in
the rest of the State, and Governor Pierpoint was
recognized as the genuine governor of Virginia,
although few Virginians acknowledged allegiance
to him, and often there were not many square
miles of the Old Dominion upon which the dispossessed
ruler could safely set his foot. For the present
he certainly was no despot, but in the future he
might have usefulness. He preserved continuity;
by virtue of him, so to speak, there still was a State
of Virginia.</p>

<p>Somewhat early in the war large portions of
Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas were recovered
and kept by Union forces, and beneath such protection
a considerable Union sentiment found expression.
The President, loath to hold for a long
time the rescued parts of these States under the
sole domination of army officers, appointed &quot;military
governors.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_55_55'></a><a href='#Footnote_55_55'><sup>[55]</sup></a> The anomalous office found an
<!-- Image No 234 --><a name='Png234'></a><a name='Page218'></a><span class="pagenum">218</span>obscure basis among those &quot;war powers&quot; which, as
a legal resting-place, resembled a quicksand, and
as a practical foundation were undeniably a rock;
the functions and authority of the officials were as
uncertain as anything, even in law, possibly could
be. Legal fiction never reached a droller point
than when these military governorships were defended
as being the fulfillment by the national
government &quot;of its high constitutional obligation
to guarantee to every State in this Union <i>a republican
form of government</i>!&quot;<a name='FNanchor_56_56'></a><a href='#Footnote_56_56'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Yet the same
distinguished gentleman, who dared gravely to
announce this ingenious argument, drew a picture
of facts which was in itself a full justification of almost
any scheme of rehabilitation; he said: &quot;The
state government has disappeared. The Executive
has abdicated; the Legislature has dissolved; the
Judiciary is in abeyance.&quot; In this condition of
chaos Mr. Lincoln was certainly bound to prevent
anarchy, without regard to any comicalities which
might creep into his technique. So these hermaphrodite
officials, with civil duties and military
rank, were very sensibly and properly given a
vague authority in the several States, as from time
to time these were in part redeemed from rebellion
by the Union armies. So soon as possible they
were bidden, in collaboration with the military
<!-- Image No 235 --><a name='Png235'></a><a name='Page219'></a><span class="pagenum">219</span>commanders in their respective districts, to make
an enrollment of loyal citizens, with a view to holding
elections and organizing state governments in
the customary form. The President was earnest,
not to say pertinacious, in urging forward these
movements. On September 11, 1863, immediately
after the battle of Chattanooga, he wrote to Andrew
Johnson that it was &quot;the nick of time for
reinaugurating a loyal state government&quot; in Tennessee;
and he suggested that, as touching this
same question of &quot;time when,&quot; it was worth while
to &quot;remember that it cannot be known who is next
to occupy the position I now hold, nor what he will
do.&quot; He warned the governor that reconstruction
must not be so conducted &quot;as to give control of
the State, and its representation in Congress, to
the enemies of the Union.... It must not be so.
You must have it otherwise. Let the reconstruction
be the work of such men only as can be trusted
for the Union. Exclude all others; and trust that
your government, so organized, will be recognized
here as being the one of republican form to be
guaranteed to the State.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_57_57'></a><a href='#Footnote_57_57'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p>At the same time these expressions by no means
indicated that the President intended to have, or
would connive at, any sham or colorable process.
Accordingly, when some one suggested a plan for
setting up as candidates in Louisiana certain Federal
<!-- Image No 236 --><a name='Png236'></a><a name='Page220'></a><span class="pagenum">220</span>
officers, who were not citizens of that State,
he decisively forbade it, sarcastically remarking to
Governor Shepley: &quot;We do not particularly want
members of Congress from there to enable us to
get along with legislation here. What we do want
is the conclusive evidence that respectable citizens
of Louisiana are willing to be members of Congress,
and to swear support to the Constitution,
and that other respectable citizens there are willing
to vote for them and send them. To send a parcel
of Northern men here as representatives, elected,
as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at
the point of the bayonet, would be disgraceful and
outrageous.&quot; Again he said that he wished the
movement for the election of members of Congress
&quot;to be a movement of the people of the district,
and not a movement of our military and quasi-military
authorities there. I merely wish our
authorities to give the people a chance,&mdash;to protect
them against secession interference.&quot; These
instructions were designed as genuine rules of
action, and were not to be construed away. Whatever
might be said against the theory which the
President was endeavoring to establish for state
restoration, no opponent of that theory was to be
given the privilege of charging that the actual conduct
of the proceedings under it was not rigidly
honest. In December, 1862, two members of Congress
were elected in Louisiana, and in February,
1863, they were admitted to take seats in the
House for the brief remnant of its existence. This
<!-- Image No 237 --><a name='Png237'></a><a name='Page221'></a><span class="pagenum">221</span>was not done without hesitation, but the fact that it
was done at all certainly was in direct line with the
President's plan. Subsequently, however, other
candidates for seats, coming from rehabilitated
States, were not so fortunate.</p>

<p>As reorganizations were attempted the promoters
generally desired that the fresh start in state life
should be made with new state Constitutions. The
conventions chosen to draw these instruments were
instructed from Washington that the validity of
the Emancipation Proclamation and of all the
legislation of Congress concerning slavery must be
distinctly admitted, if their work was to receive
recognition. Apart from this, so strenuous were
the hints conveyed to these bodies that they would
do well to arrange for the speedy abolition of slavery,
that no politician would have been so foolish
as to offer a constitution, or other form of reorganization,
without some provision of this sort. This
practical necessity sorely troubled many, who still
hoped that some happy turn of events would occur,
whereby they would be able to get back into the
Union with the pleasant and valuable group of
their slaves still about them, as in the good times
of yore. Moreover, in other matters there were
clashings between the real military commanders
and the quasi-military civilian officials; and it was
unfortunately the case that, in spite of Mr. Lincoln's
appeal to loyal men to &quot;eschew cliquism&quot;
and &quot;work together,&quot; there were abundant rivalries
and jealousies and personal schemings. All
<!-- Image No 238 --><a name='Png238'></a><a name='Page222'></a><span class="pagenum">222</span>these vexations were dragged before the President
to harass him with their pettiness amid his more
conspicuous duties; they gave him infinite trouble,
and devoured his time and strength. Likewise
they were obstacles to the advancement of the business
itself, and, coming in addition to the delays
inevitable upon elections and deliberations, they
ultimately kept all efforts towards reconstruction
dallying along until a late period in the war.
Thus it was February 22, 1864, when the state
election was held in Louisiana; and it was September
5 in the same year when the new Constitution,
with an emancipation clause, was adopted.
It was not until January, 1865, that, in Tennessee,
a convention made a constitution, for purposes of
reconstruction, and therein abolished slavery.</p>

<p>Pending these doings and before practical reconstruction
had made noticeable progress, Mr. Lincoln
sent in, on December 8, 1863, his third annual
message to Congress. To this message was appended
something which no one had anticipated,&mdash;a
proclamation of amnesty. In this the President
recited his pardoning power and a recent act
of Congress specially confirmatory thereof, stated
the wish of certain repentant rebels to resume
allegiance and to restore loyal state governments,
and then offered, to all who would take a prescribed
oath, full pardon together with &quot;restoration of all
rights and property, except as to slaves, and ... where
rights of third parties shall have intervened.&quot;
The oath was simply to &quot;support, protect, and
<!-- Image No 239 --><a name='Png239'></a><a name='Page223'></a><span class="pagenum">223</span>defend&quot; the Constitution and the Union, and to
abide by and support all legislation and all proclamations
concerning slavery made during the
existing rebellion. There were, of course, sundry
exceptions of persons from this amnesty; but the
list of those excepted was a moderate and reasonable
one. He also proclaimed that whenever in
any seceded State &quot;a number of persons not less
than one tenth in number of the votes cast in such
State at the presidential election of the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty, each
having taken the oath aforesaid and not having
since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the
election law of the State existing immediately before
the so-called act of secession, and excluding
all others, shall re&euml;stablish a state government
which shall be republican, and in no wise contravening
said oath, such shall be recognized as the
true government of the State, and the State shall
receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional
provision which declares that 'the United States
shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
republican form of government, and shall protect
each of them against invasion; and, on application
of the legislature, or the executive (when the
legislature cannot be convened), against domestic
violence.'&quot;</p>

<p>Also further: &quot;that any provision that may be
adopted by such state government, in relation to
the freed people of such State, which shall recognize
and declare their permanent freedom, provide
<!-- Image No 240 --><a name='Png240'></a><a name='Page224'></a><span class="pagenum">224</span>for their education, and which may yet be consistent,
as a temporary arrangement, with their present
condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless
class, will not be objected to by the national executive.
And it is suggested as not improper that,
in constructing a loyal state government in any
State, the name of the State, the boundary, the
subdivisions, the constitution, and the general code
of laws, as before the rebellion, be maintained,
subject only to the modifications made necessary
by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such
others, if any, not contravening said conditions,
and which may be deemed expedient by those
framing the new state government.&quot;</p>

<p>Concerning this proclamation, the message which
communicated it noted: that it did not transcend
the Constitution; that no man was coerced to take
the oath; and that to make pardon conditional
upon taking it was strictly lawful; that a test of
loyalty was necessary, because it would be &quot;simply
absurd&quot; to guarantee a republican form of government
in a State &quot;constructed in whole, or in
preponderating part, from the very element against
whose hostility and violence it is to be protected;&quot;
that the pledge to maintain the laws and proclamations
as to slavery was a proper condition, because
these had aided and would further aid the Union
cause; also because &quot;to now abandon them would
be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but
would also be a cruel and astounding breach of
faith.&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Image No 241 --><a name='Png241'></a><a name='Page225'></a><span class="pagenum">225</span>
He continued: &quot;But why any proclamation,
now, upon the subject? This question is beset
with the conflicting views that the step might be
delayed too long or be taken too soon. In some
States the elements for resumption seem ready for
action, but remain inactive, apparently for want
of a rallying point,&mdash;a plan of action. Why shall
A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of A?
And if A and B should agree, how can they
know but that the general government here will
reject their plan? By the proclamation a plan is
presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying
point, and which they are assured in advance
will not be rejected here. This may bring them to
act sooner than they otherwise would.</p>

<p>&quot;The objection to a premature presentation of
a plan by the national executive consists in the
danger of committals on points which could be
more safely left to further developments.</p>

<p>&quot;Care has been taken to so shape the document
as to avoid embarrassments from this source.
Saying that, on certain terms, certain classes will
be pardoned, with rights restored, it is not said
that other classes or other terms will never be
included. Saying that reconstruction will be accepted
if presented in a specified way, it is not
said it will never be accepted in any other way.</p>

<p>&quot;The movements, by state action, for emancipation
in several of the States, not included in the
emancipation proclamation, are matters of profound
gratulation. And while I do not repeat in
<!-- Image No 242 --><a name='Png242'></a><a name='Page226'></a><span class="pagenum">226</span>detail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged
upon this subject, my general views and feelings
remain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will
omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important
steps to a great consummation.</p>

<p>&quot;In the midst of other cares, however important,
we must not lose sight of the fact that the
war power is still our main reliance. To that
power alone we can look yet for a time, to give
confidence to the people in the contested regions,
that the insurgent power will not again overrun
them. Until that confidence shall be established,
little can be done anywhere for what is called
reconstruction.</p>

<p>&quot;Hence our chiefest care must be directed to
the army and navy, who have thus far borne their
harder part so nobly and well. And it may be
esteemed fortunate that in giving the greatest efficiency
to these indispensable arms, we do also
honorably recognize the gallant men, from commander
to sentinel, who compose them, and to
whom, more than to others, the world must stand
indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled,
regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.&quot;</p>

<p>This step, this offer of amnesty and pardon, and
invitation to state reconstruction, took every one
by surprise. As usual the President had been
&quot;doing his own thinking,&quot; reaching his own conclusions
and acting upon them with little counsel
asked from any among the multitudes of wise men
who were so ready to furnish it. For a moment
<!-- Image No 243 --><a name='Png243'></a><a name='Page227'></a><span class="pagenum">227</span>his action received a gratifying welcome of praise
and approval. The first impulsive sentiment was
that of pleasure because the offer was in so liberal,
so conciliatory, so forgiving a spirit; moreover,
people were encouraged by the very fact that the
President thought it worth while to initiate reconstruction;
also many of the more weak-kneed, who
desired to see the luring process tried, were gratified
by a generous measure. Then, too, not very
much thought had yet been given, at least by the
people in general, to actual processes of reconstruction;
for while many doubted whether there
would ever be a chance to reconstruct at all, very
few fancied the time for it to be nearly approaching.
Therefore the President occupied vacant
ground in the minds of most persons.</p>

<p>But in a short time a very different temper was
manifested among members of Congress, and from
them spread forth and found support among the
people. Two reasons promoted this. One, which
was avowed with the frankness of indignation, was
a jealousy of seeing so important a business preempted
by the executive department. The other
was a natural feeling of mingled hostility and
distrust towards rebels, who had caused so much
blood to be shed, so much cost to be incurred. In
this point of view, the liberality which at first had
appeared admirable now began to be condemned
as extravagant, unreasonable, and perilous.</p>

<p>Concerning the first of these reasons, it must be
admitted that it was entirely natural that Congress
<!-- Image No 244 --><a name='Png244'></a><a name='Page228'></a><span class="pagenum">228</span>should desire to take partial or, if possible, even
entire charge of reconstruction. Which department
had the better right to the duty, or how it
should be distributed between the legislative and
executive departments, was uncertain, and could
be determined only by inference from the definite
functions of each as established by the Constitution.
The executive unquestionably had the power
to pardon every rebel in the land; yet it was a
power which might conceivably be so misused as to
justify impeachment. The Senate and the House
had the power to give or to refuse seats to persons
claiming to have been elected to them. Yet they
could not dare to exercise this power except for a
cause which was at least colorable in each case.
Furthermore, the meaning of &quot;recognition&quot; was
vague. Exactly what was &quot;recognition&quot; of a state
government, and by what specific process could it
be granted or withheld? The executive might
recognize statehood in some matters; Congress
might refuse to recognize it in other matters.
Every one felt that disagreement between the two
departments would be most unfortunate and even
dangerous; yet it was entirely possible; and what
an absurd and alarming condition might be created,
if the President, by a general amnesty,
should reinstate the ex-rebels of a State as citizens
with all their rights of citizenship, and Congress
should refuse to seat the senators and representatives
elected by these constituents on the alleged
ground of peril to the country by reason of their
<!-- Image No 245 --><a name='Png245'></a><a name='Page229'></a><span class="pagenum">229</span>supposed continuing disloyalty. Even worse still
might be the case; for the Senate and the House
might disagree. There was nothing in law or logic
to make this consummation impossible.</p>

<p>People differed much in feeling as well as
opinion upon this difficult subject, this problem
which was solved by no law. Treason is a crime
and must be made odious, said Andrew Johnson,
sternly uttering the sentiments of many earnest
and strenuous men in Congress and in the country.
Others were able to eliminate revengefulness, but
felt that it was not safe in the present, nor wise
for the future, to restore to rebels all the rights
of citizenship upon the moment when they should
consent to abandon rebellion, more especially when
all knew and admitted that the abandonment was
made not in penitence but merely in despair of
success. It was open to extremists to argue that
the whole seceded area might logically, as conquered
lands, be reduced to a territorial condition,
to be recarved into States at such times and
upon such conditions as should seem proper. But
others, in agreement with the President, insisted
that if no State could lawfully secede, it followed
that no State could lawfully be deprived of statehood.
These persons reinforced their legal argument
with the sentimental one that lenity was the
best policy. As General Grant afterward put it:
&quot;The people who had been in rebellion must necessarily
come back into the Union, and be incorporated
as an integral part of the nation. Naturally
<!-- Image No 246 --><a name='Png246'></a><a name='Page230'></a><span class="pagenum">230</span>the nearer they were placed to an equality with the
people who had not rebelled, the more reconciled
they would feel with their old antagonists, and the
better citizens they would be from the beginning.
They surely would not make good citizens if they
felt that they had a yoke around their necks.&quot;
The question, in what proportions mercy and justice
should be, or safely could be, mingled, was
clearly one of discretion. In the wide distance
betwixt the holders of extreme opinions an infinite
variety of schemes and theories was in time
broached and held. Very soon the gravity of the
problem was greatly enhanced by its becoming
complicated with proposals for giving the suffrage
to negroes. Upon this Mr. Lincoln expressed his
opinion that the privilege might be wisely conferred
upon &quot;the very intelligent, and especially
those who have fought gallantly in our ranks,&quot;
though apparently he intended thus to describe no
very large percentage. Apparently his confidence
in the civic capacity of the negro never became
very much greater than it had been in the days of
the joint debates with Douglas.</p>

<p>Congress took up the matter very promptly,
and with much display of feeling. Early in May,
1864, Henry Winter Davis, a vehement opponent
of the President, introduced a bill, of which the
anti-rebel preamble was truculent to the point of
being amusing. His first fierce <i>Whereas</i> declared
that the Confederate States were waging a war so
glaringly unjust &quot;that they have no right to claim
<!-- Image No 247 --><a name='Png247'></a><a name='Page231'></a><span class="pagenum">231</span>the mitigation of the extreme rights of war, which
are accorded by modern usage to an enemy who
has a right to consider the war a just one.&quot; But
Congress, though hotly irritated, was not quite
willing to say, in terms, that it would eschew civilization
and adopt barbarism, as its system for the
conduct of the war; and accordingly it rejected
Mr. Davis's fierce exordium. The words had very
probably only been used by him as a sort of safety
valve to give vent to the fury of his wrath, so that
he could afterward approach the serious work of
the bill in a milder spirit; for in fact the actual
effective legislation which he proposed was by
no means unreasonable. After military resistance
should be suppressed in any rebellious State, the
white male citizens were to elect a convention for
the purpose of re&euml;stablishing a state government.
The new organization must disfranchise prominent
civil and military officers of the Confederacy,
establish the permanent abolition of slavery, and
prohibit the payment by the new State of any
indebtedness incurred for Confederate purposes.
After Congress should have expressed its assent to
the work of the convention, the President was to
recognize by proclamation the reorganized State.
This bill, of course, gave to the legislative department
the whole valuable control in the matter of
recognition, leaving to the President nothing more
than the mere empty function of issuing a proclamation,
which he would have no right to hold
back; but in other respects its requirements were
<!-- Image No 248 --><a name='Png248'></a><a name='Page232'></a><span class="pagenum">232</span>entirely fair and unobjectionable, from any point
of view, and it finally passed the House by a vote
of 74 to 59. The Senate amended it, but afterward
receded from the amendment, and thus the
measure came before Mr. Lincoln on July 4, 1864.
Congress was to adjourn at noon on that day, and
he was at the Capitol, signing bills, when this one
was brought to him. He laid it aside. Zachariah
Chandler, senator from Michigan, a dictatorial
gentleman and somewhat of the busybody order,
was watchfully standing by, and upon observing
this action, he asked Mr. Lincoln, with some show
of feeling, whether he was not going to sign that
bill. Mr. Lincoln replied that it was a &quot;matter
of too much importance to be swallowed in that
way.&quot; Mr. Chandler warned him that a veto
would be very damaging at the Northwest, and
said: &quot;The important point is that one prohibiting
slavery in the reconstructed States.&quot; &quot;This is
the point,&quot; said Mr. Lincoln, &quot;on which I doubt
the authority of Congress to act.&quot; &quot;It is no more
than you have done yourself,&quot; said the senator.
&quot;I conceive,&quot; replied Mr. Lincoln, &quot;that I may in
an emergency do things on military grounds which
cannot be done constitutionally by Congress.&quot; A
few moments later he remarked to the members of
the cabinet: &quot;I do not see how any of us now
can deny and contradict what we have always said:
that Congress has no constitutional power over
slavery in the States.... This bill and the position
of these gentlemen seem to me, in asserting
<!-- Image No 249 --><a name='Png249'></a><a name='Page233'></a><span class="pagenum">233</span>that the insurrectionary States are no longer in
the Union, to make the fatal admission that States,
whenever they please, may of their own motion
dissolve their connection with the Union. Now
we cannot survive that admission, I am convinced.
If that be true, I am not President; these gentlemen
are not Congress. I have laboriously endeavored
to avoid that question ever since it first
began to be mooted.... It was to obviate this
question that I earnestly favored the movement
for an amendment to the Constitution abolishing
slavery.... I thought it much better, if it were
possible, to restore the Union without the necessity
for a violent quarrel among its friends as to
whether certain States have been in or out of the
Union during the war,&mdash;a merely metaphysical
question, and one unnecessary to be forced into
discussion.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_58_58'></a><a href='#Footnote_58_58'><sup>[58]</sup></a> So the bill remained untouched at
his side.</p>

<p>A few days after the adjournment, having then
decided not to sign the bill, he issued a proclamation
in which he said concerning it, that he was
&quot;unprepared by a formal approval of [it] to be
inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration;&quot;
that he was also &quot;unprepared to declare
that the free-state constitutions and governments,
already adopted and installed in Arkansas and
Louisiana, [should] be set aside and held for
naught, thereby repelling and discouraging the
<!-- Image No 250 --><a name='Png250'></a><a name='Page234'></a><span class="pagenum">234</span>loyal citizens, who have set up the same, as to
further effort;&quot; also that he was unprepared to
&quot;declare a constitutional competency in Congress
to abolish slavery in the States.&quot; Yet he also
said that he was fully satisfied that the system proposed
in the bill was &quot;<i>one</i> very proper plan&quot; for
the loyal people of any State to adopt, and that he
should be ready to aid in such adoption upon any
opportunity. In a word, his objection to the bill
lay chiefly in the fact that it established one single
and exclusive process for reconstruction. The
rigid exclusiveness seemed to him a serious error.
Upon his part, in putting forth his own plan, he
had taken much pains distinctly to keep out this
characteristic, and to have it clearly understood
that his proposition was not designed as &quot;a procrustean
bed, to which exact conformity was to be
indispensable;&quot; it was not <i>the only</i> method, but
only <i>a</i> method.</p>

<p>So soon as it was known that the President
would not sign the bill, a vehement cry of wrath
broke from all its more ardent friends. H.W.
Davis and B.F. Wade, combative men, and leaders
in their party, who expected their opinion to be
respected, published in the New York &quot;Tribune&quot;
an address &quot;To the Supporters of the Government.&quot;
In unbridled language they charged &quot;encroachments
of the executive on the authority of
Congress.&quot; They even impugned the honesty of
the President's purpose in words of direct personal
insult; for they said: &quot;The President, by preventing
<!-- Image No 251 --><a name='Png251'></a><a name='Page235'></a><span class="pagenum">235</span>
this bill from becoming a law, holds the electoral
votes of the rebel States at the dictation of his
personal ambition.... If electors for president
be allowed to be chosen in either of those States
[Louisiana or Arkansas], a sinister light will be
cast on [his] motives.&quot; They alleged that &quot;a more
studied outrage on the legislative authority of the
people has never been perpetrated.&quot; They stigmatized
this &quot;rash and fatal act&quot; as &quot;a blow at
the friends of the administration, at the rights
of humanity, and at the principles of republican
government.&quot; They warned Mr. Lincoln that, if
he wished the support of Congress, he must &quot;confine
himself to his executive duties,&mdash;to obey and
execute, not make the laws; to suppress by arms
armed rebellion, and leave political reorganization
to Congress.&quot; If they really meant what they
said, or any considerable part of it, they would
have been obliged to vote &quot;Guilty&quot; had the House
of Representatives seen fit to put these newspaper
charges of theirs into the formal shape of articles
of impeachment against the President.</p>

<p>To whatever &quot;friends&quot; Mr. Lincoln might have
dealt a &quot;blow,&quot; it is certain that these angry
gentlemen, whether &quot;friends&quot; or otherwise, were
dealing him a very severe blow at a very critical
time; and if its hurtfulness was diminished by
the very fury and extravagance of their invective,
they at least were entitled to no credit for the salvation
thus obtained. They were exerting all their
powerful influence to increase the chance, already
<!-- Image No 252 --><a name='Png252'></a><a name='Page236'></a><span class="pagenum">236</span>alarmingly great, of making a Democrat the next
President of the United States. Nevertheless Mr.
Lincoln, with his wonted imperturbable fixedness
when he had reached a conviction, did not modify
his position in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>Before long this especial explosion spent its
force, and thereafter very fortunately the question
smouldered during the rest of Mr. Lincoln's lifetime,
and only burst forth into fierce flame immediately
after his death, when it became more
practical and urgent as a problem of the actually
present time. The last words, however, which he
spoke in public, dealt with the matter. It was on
the evening of April 11, and he was addressing in
Washington a great concourse of citizens who had
gathered to congratulate him upon the brilliant
military successes, then just achieved, which insured
the immediate downfall of the Confederacy.
In language as noteworthy for moderation as that
of his assailants had been for extravagance, he
then reviewed his course concerning reconstruction
and gave his reasons for still believing that he had
acted for the best. Admitting that much might
justly be said against the reorganized government
of Louisiana, he explained why he thought that
nevertheless it should not be rejected. Concede,
he said, that it is to what it should be only what
the egg is to the fowl, &quot;we shall sooner have the
fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it.&quot;
He conceived that the purpose of the people might
be fairly stated to be the restoration of the proper
<!-- Image No 253 --><a name='Png253'></a><a name='Page237'></a><span class="pagenum">237</span>practical relations between the seceded States and
the Union, and he therefore argued that the question
properly took this shape: Whether Louisiana
could &quot;be brought into proper practical relation
with the Union <i>sooner</i> by <i>sustaining</i> or by <i>discarding</i>
her new state government.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_59_59'></a><a href='#Footnote_59_59'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p>By occurrences befalling almost immediately
after Mr. Lincoln's death his opinions were again
drawn into debate, when unfortunately he could
neither explain nor develop them further than he
had done. One of the important events of the war
was the conference held on March 28, 1865, at
Hampton Roads, between the President, General
Grant, General Sherman, and Admiral Porter, and
at which no other person was present. It is sufficiently
agreed that the two generals then declared
that one great final battle must yet take place; and
that thereupon Mr. Lincoln, in view of the admitted
fact that the collapse of the rebellion was inevitably
close at hand, expressed great aversion and
pain at the prospect of utterly useless bloodshed,
and asked whether it could not by some means
be avoided. It is also tolerably certain that Mr.
<!-- Image No 254 --><a name='Png254'></a><a name='Page238'></a><span class="pagenum">238</span>Lincoln gave very plainly to be understood by his
remarks, and also as usual by a story, his desire
that Jefferson Davis and a few other of the leading
rebels should not be captured, but rather should
find it possible to escape from the country. It is
in other ways well known that he had already
made up his mind not to conclude the war with
a series of hangings after the historic European
fashion of dealing with traitors. He preferred,
however, to evade rather than to encounter the
problem of disposing of such embarrassing captives,
and a road for them out of the country would
be also a road for him out of a difficulty. What
else was said on this occasion, though it soon became
the basis of important action, is not known
with accuracy; but it may be regarded as beyond
a doubt that, in a general way, Mr. Lincoln took
a very liberal tone concerning the terms and treatment
to be accorded to the rebels in the final arrangement
of the surrendering, which all saw to
be close at hand. It is beyond doubt that he
spoke, throughout the conference, in the spirit of
forgetting and forgiving immediately and almost
entirely.</p>

<p>From this interview General Sherman went back
to his army, and received no further instructions
afterward, until, on April 18, he established with
General Johnston the terms on which the remaining
Confederate forces should be disbanded. This
&quot;Memorandum or basis of agreement,&quot;<a name='FNanchor_60_60'></a><a href='#Footnote_60_60'><sup>[60]</sup></a> then entered
into by him, stipulated for &quot;the recognition
<!-- Image No 255 --><a name='Png255'></a><a name='Page239'></a><span class="pagenum">239</span>by the executive of the United States, of the several
state governments, on their officers and legislatures
taking the oaths prescribed by the Constitution
of the United States;&quot; also that the inhabitants
of the Southern States should &quot;be guaranteed, so
far as the executive can, their political rights and
franchises, as well as their rights of person and
property;&quot; also that the government would not
&quot;disturb any of the people by reason of the late
war,&quot; if they should dwell quiet for the future;
and, in short, that there should be &quot;a general
amnesty,&quot; so far as it was within the power of the
executive of the United States to grant it, upon
the return of the South to a condition of peace.</p>

<p>No sooner were these engagements reported in
Washington than they were repudiated. However
they might have accorded with, or might
have transcended, the sentiments of him who had
been president only a few days before, they by no
means accorded with the views of Andrew Johnson,
who was president at that time, and still less
with the views of the secretary of war, who well
represented the vengeful element of the country.
Accordingly Mr. Stanton at once annulled them
by an order, which he followed up by a bulletin
containing ten reasons in support of the order.
This document was immediately published in the
newspapers, and was so vituperative and insulting
towards Sherman<a name='FNanchor_61_61'></a><a href='#Footnote_61_61'><sup>[61]</sup></a> that the general, who naturally
<!-- Image No 256 --><a name='Png256'></a><a name='Page240'></a><span class="pagenum">240</span>did not feel himself a fitting object for insolence
at this season of his fresh military triumphs, soon
afterward showed his resentment; at the grand
parade of his army, in Washington, he conspicuously
declined, in the presence of the President
and the notabilities of the land, to shake the hand
which Secretary Stanton did not hesitate then and
there to extend to him,&mdash;for Stanton had that
peculiar and unusual form of meanness which endeavors
to force a civility after an insult. But
however General Sherman might feel about it, his
capitulation had been revoked, and another conference
became necessary between the two generals,
which was followed a little later by still another
between Generals Schofield and Johnston. At
these meetings the terms which had been established
between Generals Grant and Lee were substantially
repeated, and by this &quot;military convention&quot;
the war came to a formal end on April 26,
1865.</p>

<p>By this course of events General Sherman was,
of course, placed in a very uncomfortable position,
and he defended himself by alleging that the terms
which he had made were in accurate conformity
with the opinions, wishes, and programme expressed
by Mr. Lincoln on March 28. He reiterates
this assertion strongly and distinctly in his
&quot;Memoirs,&quot; and quotes in emphatic corroboration
Admiral Porter's account of that interview.<a name='FNanchor_62_62'></a><a href='#Footnote_62_62'><sup>[62]</sup></a> The
<!-- Image No 257 --><a name='Png257'></a><a name='Page241'></a><span class="pagenum">241</span>only other witness who could be heard on this point
was General Grant; he never gave his recollection
of the expressions of President Lincoln concerning
the matters in dispute; but on April 21 he
did write to General Sherman that, after having
carefully read the terms accorded to Johnston he
felt satisfied that they &quot;could not possibly be approved.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_63_63'></a><a href='#Footnote_63_63'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
He did not, however, say whether or
not they seemed to him to contravene the policy of
the President, as he had heard or understood that
policy to be laid down in the famous interview.
In the obscurity which wraps this matter, individual
opinions find ample room to wander; it is
easy to believe that what General Sherman undertook
to arrange was in reasonable accordance with
the broad purposes of the President; but it certainly
is not easy to believe that the President ever
intended that so many, so momentous, and such
complex affairs should be conclusively disposed of,
with all the honorable sacredness attendant upon
military capitulations, by a few hasty strokes of
General Sherman's pen. The comprehensiveness
of this brief and sudden document of surrender
was appalling! Mr. Lincoln had never before
shown any inclination to depute to others so much
of his own discretionary authority; his habit was
quite the other way.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 258 --><a name='Png258'></a><a name='Page242'></a><span class="pagenum">242</span>
It is not worth while to discuss much the merits
or demerits of President Lincoln's schemes for
reconstruction. They had been only roughly and
imperfectly blocked out at the time of his death;
and in presenting them he repeatedly stated that
he did not desire to rule out other schemes which
might be suggested; on the contrary, he distinctly
stated his approval of the scheme developed in the
bill introduced by Senator Davis and passed by
Congress. Reconstruction, as it was actually conducted
later on, was wretchedly bungled, and was
marked chiefly by bitterness in disputation and
by clumsiness in practical arrangements, which
culminated in that miserable disgrace known as
the regime of the &quot;carpet-baggers.&quot; How far
Lincoln would have succeeded in saving the country
from these humiliating processes, no one can
say; but that he would have strenuously disapproved
much that was done is not open to reasonable
doubt. On the other hand, it is by no means
certain that his theories, at least so far as they had
been developed up to the time of his death, either
could have been, or ought to have been carried out.
This seems to be generally agreed. Perhaps they
were too liberal; perhaps he confided too much in
a sudden change of heart, an immediate growth of
loyalty, among persons of whom nearly all were
still embittered, still believed that it was in a righteous
cause that they had suffered a cruel defeat.</p>

<p>But if the feasibility of Mr. Lincoln's plan is
matter of fruitless disputation, having to do only
<!-- Image No 259 --><a name='Png259'></a><a name='Page243'></a><span class="pagenum">243</span>with fancied probabilities, and having never been
put to the proof of trial, at least no one will deny
that it was creditable to his nature. A strange
freak of destiny arranged that one of the most
obstinate, sanguinary wars of history should be
conducted by one of the most humane men who
ever lived, and that blood should run in rivers at
the order of a ruler to whom bloodshed was repugnant,
and to whom the European idol of military
glory seemed a symbol of barbarism. During the
war Lincoln's chief purpose was the restoration
of national unity, and his day-dream was that it
should be achieved as a sincere and hearty reunion
in feeling as well as in fact. As he dwelt with
much earnest aspiration upon this consummation,
he perhaps came to imagine a possibility of its instant
accomplishment, which did not really exist.
His longing for a genuinely reunited country was
not a pious form of expression, but an intense sentiment,
and an end which he definitely expected
to bring to pass. Not improbably this frame of
mind induced him to advance too fast and too far,
in order to meet with welcoming hand persons who
were by no means in such a condition of feeling
that they could grasp that hand in good faith, or
could fulfill at once the obligations which such a
reconciliation would have imposed upon them, as
matter of honor, in all their civil and political relations.
The reaction involved in passing from a
state of hostilities to a state of peace, the deep
gratification of seeing so mortal a struggle determined
<!-- Image No 260 --><a name='Png260'></a><a name='Page244'></a><span class="pagenum">244</span>
in favor of the national life, may have carried
him somewhat beyond the limitations set by
the hard facts of the case, and by the human
nature alike of the excited conquerors and the
impenitent conquered. On the other hand, however,
it is dangerous to say that Mr. Lincoln made
a mistake in reading the popular feeling or in
determining a broad policy. If he did, he did so
for the first time. Among those suppositions in
which posterity is free to indulge, it is possible
to fancy that if he, whom all now admit to have
been the best friend of the South living in April,
1865, had continued to live longer, he might have
alleviated, if he could not altogether have prevented,
the writing of some very painful chapters
in the history of the United States.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2>RENOMINATION</h2>

<p>In a period of fervid political feeling it was
natural that those Republicans who were dissatisfied
with President Lincoln should begin, long
before the close of his term of office, to seek consolation
by arrangements for replacing him by a
successor more to their taste. Expressions of this
purpose became definite in the autumn of 1863.
Mr. Arnold says that the coming presidential
election was expected to bring grave danger, if not
even anarchy and revolution.<a name='FNanchor_64_64'></a><a href='#Footnote_64_64'><sup>[64]</sup></a> Amid existing circumstances,
an opposition confined to the legitimate
antagonism of the Democracy would, of
course, have brought something more than the
customary strain inherent in ordinary times in
government by party; and it was unfortunate that,
besides this, an undue gravity was imported into
the crisis by the intestinal dissensions of the
Republicans themselves. It seemed by no means
impossible that these disagreements might give to
the friends of peace by compromise a victory
<!-- Image No 262 --><a name='Png262'></a><a name='Page246'></a><span class="pagenum">246</span>which they really ought not to have. Republican
hostility to Mr. Lincoln was unquestionably very
bitter in quality, whatever it might be in quantity.
It was based in part upon the discontent of the
radicals and extremists, in part upon personal irritation.
In looking back upon those times there is
now a natural tendency to measure this opposition
by the weakness which it ultimately displayed
when, later on, it was swept out of sight by the
overwhelming current of the popular will. But
this weakness was by no means so visible in the
winter of 1863-64. On the contrary, the cry for
a change then seemed to come from every quarter,
and to come loudly; for it was echoed back and
forth by the propagandists and politicians, and
as these persons naturally did most of the talking
and writing in the country, so they made a show
delusively out of proportion to their following
among the people.</p>

<p>The dislike toward the President flourished
chiefly in two places, and with two distinct bodies
of men. One of these places was Missouri, which
will be spoken of later on. The other was Washington,
where the class of &quot;public men&quot; was for
the most part very ill-disposed towards him.<a name='FNanchor_65_65'></a><a href='#Footnote_65_65'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Mr.
Julian, himself a prominent malcontent, bears his
valuable testimony to the extent of the disaffection,
saying that, of the &quot;more earnest and thorough-going
Republicans in both Houses of Congress,
<!-- Image No 263 --><a name='Png263'></a><a name='Page247'></a><span class="pagenum">247</span>probably not one in ten really favored&quot;<a name='FNanchor_66_66'></a><a href='#Footnote_66_66'><sup>[66]</sup></a> the renomination
of Mr. Lincoln. In fact, there were
few of them whom the President had not offended.
They had brought to him their schemes and their
policies, had made their arguments and demands,
and after all had found the President keeping his
counsel to himself and acting according to his own
judgment. This seemed exasperatingly unjustifiable
in a country where anybody might happen to
be president without being a whit abler than any
other one who had not happened to fall into the
office. In a word, the politicians had, and hated,
a master. Mr. Chase betrayed this when he complained
that there was no &quot;administration, in the
true sense of the word;&quot; by which he understood,
&quot;a president conferring with his cabinet and <i>taking
their united judgments</i>.&quot; The existence of
that strange moat which seems to isolate the capital
and the political coteries therein gathered, and
to shut out all knowledge of the feelings of the
constituent people, is notorious, and certainly was
never made more conspicuous than in this business
of selecting the Republican candidate for the campaign
of 1864. When Congress came together
the political scheming received a strong impetus.
Everybody seemed to be opposed to Mr. Lincoln.
Thaddeus Stevens, the impetuous leader of the
House of Representatives, declared that, in that
body, Arnold of Illinois was the only member who
<!-- Image No 264 --><a name='Png264'></a><a name='Page248'></a><span class="pagenum">248</span>was a political friend of the President; and the
story goes that the President himself sadly admitted
the fact. Visitors at Washington, who got their
impressions from the talk there, concluded that
Mr. Lincoln's chance of a second term was small.</p>

<p>This opposition, which had the capital for its
headquarters and the politicians for its constituents,
found a candidate ready for use. Secretary
Chase was a victim to the dread disease of presidential
ambition. With the usual conventional
expressions of modesty he admitted the fact.
Thereupon general talk soon developed into political
organization; and in January, 1864, a &quot;Committee
of prominent Senators, Representatives, and
Citizens,&quot; having formally obtained his approval,
set about promoting his interests in business-like
fashion.</p>

<p>The President soon knew what was going forward;
but he gave no sign of disquietude; on the
contrary, he only remarked that he hoped the
country would never have a worse president than
Mr. Chase would be. Not that he was indifferent
to renomination and re&euml;lection. That would have
been against nature. His mind, his soul, all that
there was of force and feeling in him had been
expended to the uttermost in the cause and the
war which were still pending. At the end of that
desperate road, along which he had dared stubbornly
and against so much advice to lead the
nation, he seemed now to discern the goal. That
he should be permitted to guide to the end in that
<!-- Image No 265 --><a name='Png265'></a>
<!-- Image No 266 --><a name='Png266'></a>
<!-- Image No 267 --><a name='Png267'></a><a name='Page249'></a><span class="pagenum">249</span>
journey, and that his judgment and leadership
should receive the crown of success and approval,
was a reward, almost a right, which he must intensely
desire and which he could not lose without
a disappointment that outruns expression. Yet he
was so self-contained that, if he had cared not at
all about the issue, his conduct would have been
much the same that it was.</p>

<p>Besides his temperament, other causes promoted
this tranquillity. What Mr. Lincoln would have
been had his career fallen in ordinary times, amid
commonplace political business, it is difficult to
say. The world never saw him as the advocate or
assailant of a tariff, or other such affair. From
the beginning he had bound himself fast to a great
moral purpose, which later became united with the
preservation of the national life. Having thus
deliberately exercised his judgment in a question
of this kind, he seemed ever after content to have
intrusted his fortunes to the movement, and always
to be free from any misgiving as to its happy conclusion.
Besides this, it is probable that he accurately
measured the narrow limits of Mr. Chase's
strength. No man ever more shrewdly read the
popular mind. A subtle line of communication
seemed to run between himself and the people.
Nor did he know less well the politicians. His
less sagacious friends noted with surprise and
anxiety that he let the work of opposition go on
unchecked. In due time, however, the accuracy of
his foresight was vindicated; for when the secretary's
<!-- Image No 268 --><a name='Png268'></a><a name='Page250'></a><span class="pagenum">250</span>
friends achieved a sufficient impetus they
tumbled over, in manner following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Pomeroy, senator from Kansas, was vindictive
because the President had refused to take
his side in certain quarrels between himself and
his colleague. Accordingly, early in 1864, he
issued a circular, stating that the efforts making
for Mr. Lincoln's nomination required counter
action on the part of those unconditional friends
of the Union who disapproved the policy of the
administration. He said that Mr. Lincoln's re&euml;lection
was &quot;practically impossible;&quot; that it was
also undesirable, on account of the President's
&quot;manifest tendency towards compromises and
temporary expedients of policy,&quot; and for other
reasons. Therefore, he said, Mr. Chase's friends
had established &quot;connections in all the States,&quot;
and now invited &quot;the hearty co&ouml;peration of all
those in favor of the speedy restoration of the
Union upon the basis of universal freedom.&quot; The
document, designed to be secret, of course was
quickly printed in the newspapers.<a name='FNanchor_67_67'></a><a href='#Footnote_67_67'><sup>[67]</sup></a> This was
awkward; and Mr. Chase at once wrote to the
President a letter, certainly entirely fair, in which
he expressed his willingness to resign. Mr. Lincoln
replied kindly. He said that he had heard
of the Pomeroy circular, but had not read it, and
did not expect to do so. In fact, he said, &quot;I
have known just as little of these things as my
friends have allowed me to know.&quot; As to the
<!-- Image No 269 --><a name='Png269'></a><a name='Page251'></a><span class="pagenum">251</span>proposed resignation, that, he said, &quot;is a question
which I will not allow myself to consider from any
standpoint other than my judgment of the public
service, and in that view I do not perceive occasion
for a change.&quot; There was throughout a quiet
undertone of indifference to the whole business,
which was significant enough to have puzzled the
secretary, had he noticed it; for it was absolutely
impossible that Mr. Lincoln should be really
indifferent to dangerous competition. The truth
was that the facts of the situation lay with the
President, and that the enterprise, which was
supposed by its friends to be only in its early
stage, was really on the verge of final disposition.
Mr. Chase had said decisively that he would
not be a candidate unless his own State, Ohio,
should prefer him. To enlighten him on this
point the Republican members of the Ohio legislature,
being in much closer touch with the people
than were the more dignified statesmen at Washington,
met on February 25, and in the name of
the people and the soldiers of their State renominated
Mr. Lincoln. The nail was driven a stroke
deeper into the coffin by Rhode Island. Although
Governor Sprague was Mr. Chase's son-in-law,
the legislature of that State also made haste to
declare for Mr. Lincoln. So the movement in
behalf of Mr. Chase came suddenly and utterly
to an end. Early in May he wrote that he wished
no further consideration to be given to his name;
and his wish was respected. After this collapse
<!-- Image No 270 --><a name='Png270'></a><a name='Page252'></a><span class="pagenum">252</span>Mr. Lincoln's renomination was much less opposed
by the politicians of Washington. Being naturally
a facile class, and not so narrowly wedded to
their own convictions as to be unable to subordinate
them to the popular will or wisdom, they now
for the most part gave their superficial and uncordial
adhesion to the President. They liked him
no better than before, but they respected a sagacity
superior to their own, bowed before a capacity
which could control success, and, in presence of the
admitted fact of his overwhelming popularity, they
played the part which became wise men of their
calling.</p>

<p>However sincerely Mr. Chase might resolve to
behave with magnanimity beneath his disappointment,
the disappointment must rankle all the
same. It was certainly the case that, while he
professed friendship towards Mr. Lincoln personally,
he was honestly unable to appreciate him as a
president. Mr. Chase's ideal of a statesman had
outlines of imposing dignity which Mr. Lincoln's
simple demeanor did not fill out. It was now inevitable
that the relationship between the two men
should soon be severed. The first strain came
because Mr. Lincoln would not avenge an unjustifiable
assault made by General Blair upon the
secretary. Then Mr. Chase grumbled at the free
spending of the funds which he had succeeded in
providing with so much skill and labor. &quot;It seems
as if there were no limit to expense.... The
spigot in Uncle Abe's barrel is made twice as big
<!-- Image No 271 --><a name='Png271'></a><a name='Page253'></a><span class="pagenum">253</span>as the bung-hole,&quot; he complained. Then ensued
sundry irritations concerning appointments in the
custom-houses, one of which led to an offer of
resignation by the secretary. On each occasion,
however, the President placated him by allowing
him to have his own way. Finally, in May and
June, 1864, occurred the famous imbroglio concerning
the choice of a successor to Mr. Cisco, the
assistant treasurer at New York. Though Mr.
Chase again managed to prevail, yet he was made
so angry by the circumstances of the case, that
he again sent in his resignation, which this time
was accepted. For, as Mr. Lincoln said: &quot;You
and I have reached a point of mutual embarrassment
in our official relation, which it seems cannot
be overcome or longer sustained consistently
with the public service.&quot; This occurrence, taking
place on June 29-30, at the beginning of the difficult
political campaign of that anxious summer,
alienated from the President's cause some friends
in a crisis when all the friends whom he could
muster seemed hardly sufficient.</p>

<p>The place of Mr. Chase was not easy to fill.
Mr. Lincoln first nominated David Tod of Ohio.
This was very ill received; but fortunately the
difficulty which might have been caused by it was
escaped, because Governor Tod promptly declined.
The President then named William Pitt Fessenden,
senator from Maine, and actually forced the
office upon him against that gentleman's sincere
wish to escape the honor. A better choice could
<!-- Image No 272 --><a name='Png272'></a><a name='Page254'></a><span class="pagenum">254</span>not have been made. Mr. Fessenden was chairman
of the Committee on Finance, and had filled
the position with conspicuous ability; every one
esteemed him highly; the Senate instantly confirmed
him, and during his incumbency in office
he fully justified these flattering opinions.</p>

<p>There were other opponents of the President
who were not so easily diverted from their purpose
as the politicians had been. In Missouri an old
feud was based upon his displacement of Fremont;
the State had ever since been rent by fierce
factional quarrels, and amid them this grievance
had never been forgotten or forgiven. Emancipation
by state action had been chief among the
causes which had divided the Union citizens into
Conservatives and Radicals. Their quarrel was
bitter, and in vain did Mr. Lincoln repeatedly endeavor
to reconcile them. The Radicals claimed
his countenance as a matter of right, and Mr. Lincoln
often privately admitted that between him
and them there was close coincidence of feeling.
Yet he found their specific demands inadmissible;
especially he could not consent to please them
by removing General Schofield. So they, being
extremists, and therefore of the type of men who
will have every one against them who is not for
them, turned vindictively against him. They
found sympathizers elsewhere in the country,
sporadic instances of disaffection rather than indications
of an epidemic; but in their frame of
mind they easily gained faith in the existence of a
<!-- Image No 273 --><a name='Png273'></a><a name='Page255'></a><span class="pagenum">255</span>popular feeling which was, in fact, the phantasm
of their own heated fancy. As spring drew on
they cast out lines of affiliation. Their purpose
was not only negatively against Lincoln, but positively
for Fremont. Therefore they made connection
with the Central Fremont Club, a small
organization in New York, and issued a call for a
mass convention at Cleveland on May 31. They
expressed their disgust for the &quot;imbecile and
vacillating policy&quot; of Mr. Lincoln, and desired
the &quot;immediate extinction of slavery ... by
congressional action,&quot; contemning the fact that
Congress had no power under the Constitution
to extinguish slavery. Their call was reinforced
by two or three others, of which one came from a
&quot;People's Committee&quot; of St. Louis, representing
Germans under the lead of B. Gratz Brown.</p>

<p>The movement also had the hearty approval of
Wendell Phillips, who was very bitter and sweeping
in his denunciations of an administration which
he regarded &quot;as a civil and military failure.&quot;
Lincoln's re&euml;lection, he said, &quot;I shall consider the
end of the Union in my day, or its reconstruction
on terms worse than disunion.&quot; But Mr. Phillips's
friendship ought to have been regarded by
the Fremonters as ominous, for it was his custom
always to act with a very small minority. Moreover
he had long since ceased to give voice to the
intelligence of his party or even fairly to represent
it. How far it had ever been proper to call the
Abolitionists a party may be doubted; before the
<!-- Image No 274 --><a name='Png274'></a><a name='Page256'></a><span class="pagenum">256</span>war they had been compressed into some solidity
by encompassing hostility; but they would not
have been Abolitionists at all had they not been
men of exceptional independence both in temper
and in intellect. They had often dared to differ
from each other as well as from the mass of their
fellow citizens, and they had never submitted to
the domination of leaders in the ordinary political
fashion. The career of Mr. Lincoln had of course
been watched by them keenly, very critically, and
with intense and various feeling. At times they
had hopefully applauded him, and at times they
had vehemently condemned what had seemed to
them his halting, half-hearted, or timid action. As
the individual members of the party had often
changed their own minds about him, so also they
had sometimes and freely disagreed with each
other concerning his character, his intentions,
his policies. In the winter and spring of 1864,
however, it seemed that, by slow degrees, observation,
their own good sense, and the development of
events had at last won the great majority of the
party to repose a considerable measure of confidence
in him, both in respect of his capacity and
of his real anti-slavery purposes. Accordingly in
the present discussions such men as Owen Lovejoy,<a name='FNanchor_68_68'></a><a href='#Footnote_68_68'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
William Lloyd Garrison, and Oliver Johnson came
out fairly for him,&mdash;not, indeed, because he was
altogether satisfactory to them, but because he was
in great part so; also because they easily saw that
<!-- Image No 275 --><a name='Png275'></a><a name='Page257'></a><span class="pagenum">257</span>as matter of fact his personal triumph would probably
lead to abolition, that he was the only candidate
by whom the Democracy could be beaten, and
that if the Democracy should not be beaten, abolition
would be postponed beyond human vision.
Lovejoy said that, to his personal knowledge, the
President had &quot;been just as radical as any of his
cabinet,&quot; and in view of what the Abolitionists
thought of Chase, this was a strong indorsement.
The old-time charge of being impractical could
not properly be renewed against these men, now
that they saw that events which they could help to
bring about were likely to bring their purpose to
the point of real achievement in a near future. In
this condition of things they were found entirely
willing to recognize and accept the best practical
means, and their belief was clear that the best
practical means lay in the renomination and re&euml;lection
of Abraham Lincoln. Their adhesion brought
to him a very useful assistance, and beyond this it
also gave him the gratification of knowing that he
had at last won the approval of men whose friendly
sympathy he had always inwardly desired. Sustained
by the best men in the party, he could
afford to disregard the small body of irreconcilable
and quarrelsome fault-finders, who went over to
Fremont, factious men, who were perhaps unconsciously
controlled more by mere contradictoriness
of temperament than by the higher motives which
they proclaimed.</p>

<p>At Cleveland on the appointed day the &quot;mass
<!-- Image No 276 --><a name='Png276'></a><a name='Page258'></a><span class="pagenum">258</span>convention&quot; assembled, only the mass was wanting.
It nominated Fremont for the presidency and General
John Cochrane for the vice-presidency; and
thus again the Constitution was ignored by these
malcontents; for both these gentlemen were citizens
of New York, and therefore the important
delegation from that State could lawfully vote for
only one of them. Really the best result which
the convention achieved was that it called forth a
bit of wit from the President. Some one remarked
to him that, instead of the expected thousands,
only about four hundred persons had assembled.
He turned to the Bible which, say Nicolay and
Hay, &quot;commonly lay on his desk,&quot;<a name='FNanchor_69_69'></a><a href='#Footnote_69_69'><sup>[69]</sup></a> and read the
verse: &quot;And every one that was in distress, and
every one that was in debt, and every one that was
discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and
he became a captain over them: and there were
with him about four hundred men.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_70_70'></a><a href='#Footnote_70_70'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p>The Fremonters struck no responsive chord
among the people. The nomination was received
by every one with the same tranquil indifference,
tinged with ridicule, which the President had
shown. In vain did Fremont seek to give to his
candidacy a serious and dignified character. Very
few persons cared anything about it, except the
Democrats, and their clamorous approval was as
unwelcome as it was significant. Under this humiliation
the unfortunate candidate at last decided
to withdraw, and so notified his committee about
<!-- Image No 277 --><a name='Png277'></a><a name='Page259'></a><span class="pagenum">259</span>the middle of September. He still stood by his
principles, however, and asserted that Mr. Lincoln's
administration had been &quot;politically, militarily,
and financially a failure;&quot; that the President
had paralyzed the generous unanimity of the
North; and that, by declaring that &quot;slavery should
be protected,&quot; he had &quot;built up for the South a
strength which otherwise they could have never
attained.&quot; The nation received the statement
placidly and without alarm.</p>

<p>A feeble movement in New York to nominate
General Grant deserves mention, chiefly for the
purpose of also mentioning the generous manner
in which the general decisively brushed it aside.
Mr. Lincoln quietly said that if Grant would take
Richmond he might also have the presidency. But
it was, of course, plain to every one that for the
present it would be ridiculous folly to take Grant
out of his tent in order to put him into the White
House.</p>

<p>During this same troubled period a few of the
Republican malcontents went so far as to fancy
that they could put upon Mr. Lincoln a pressure
which would induce him to withdraw from the
ticket. They never learned the extreme absurdity
of their design, for they never got enough encouragement
to induce them to push it beyond the stage
of preliminary discussion.</p>

<p>All these movements had some support from
newspapers in different parts of the country.
Many editors had the like grievance against Mr.
<!-- Image No 278 --><a name='Png278'></a><a name='Page260'></a><span class="pagenum">260</span>Lincoln which so many politicians had. For they
had told him what to do, and too often he had not
done it. Horace Greeley, it is needless to say,
was conspicuous in his unlimited condemnation of
the President.</p>

<p>The first indications of the revolt of the politicians
and the radicals against Mr. Lincoln were
signals for instant counteracting activity among
the various bodies which more closely felt the popular
impulse. State conventions, caucuses, of all
sizes and kinds, and gatherings of the Republican
members of state legislatures, overstepped their
regular functions to declare for the renomination
of Mr. Lincoln. Clubs and societies did the same.
Simon Cameron, transmitting to the President a
circular of this purport, signed by every Unionist
member of the Pennsylvania legislature, said:
&quot;Providence has decreed your re&euml;lection;&quot; and if
it is true that the <i>vox populi</i> is also the <i>vox Dei</i>,
this statement of the political affiliations of Providence
was entirely correct. Undoubtedly the number
of the President's adherents was swelled by
some persons who would have been among the disaffected
had they not been influenced by the reflection
that a change of administration in the present
condition of things must be disastrous. This feeling
was expressed in many metaphors, but in none
other so famous as that uttered by Mr. Lincoln
himself: that it was not wise to swap horses while
crossing the stream. The process was especially
dangerous in a country where the change would
<!-- Image No 279 --><a name='Png279'></a><a name='Page261'></a><span class="pagenum">261</span>involve a practical interregum of one third of a
year. The nation had learned this lesson, and had
paid dearly enough for the schooling, too, in the
four months of its waiting to get rid of Buchanan,
after it had discredited him and all his ways. In
the present crisis it was easy to believe that to
leave Mr. Lincoln to carry on for four months an
administration condemned by the people, would
inflict a mortal injury to the Union cause. Nevertheless,
though many persons not wholly satisfied
with him supported him for this reason, the great
majority undeniably felt implicit faith and intense
loyalty towards him. He was the people's candidate,
and they would not have any other candidate;
this present state of popular feeling, which soon
became plain as the sun in heaven, settled the
matter.</p>

<p>Thereupon, however, the malcontents, unwilling
to accept defeat, broached a new scheme. The
Republican nominating convention had been summoned
to meet on June 7, 1864; the opponents of
Mr. Lincoln now sought to have it postponed until
September. William Cullen Bryant favored this.
Mr. Greeley also artfully said that a nomination
made so early would expose the Union party to a
dangerous and possibly a successful flank movement.
But deception was impossible; all knew
that the postponement itself was a flank movement,
and that it was desired for the chance of some
advantage turning up for those who now had absolutely
nothing to lose.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 280 --><a name='Png280'></a><a name='Page262'></a><span class="pagenum">262</span>
Mr. Lincoln all the while preserved the same
attitude which he had held from the beginning.
He had too much honesty and good sense to commit
the vulgar folly of pretending not to want what
every one knew perfectly well that he did want
very much. Yet no fair enemy could charge him
with doing any objectionable act to advance his
own interests. He declined to give General Schurz
leave of absence to make speeches in his behalf.
&quot;Speaking in the North,&quot; he said, &quot;and fighting
in the South at the same time are not possible;
nor could I be justified to detail any officer to the
political campaign during its continuance, and then
return him to the army.&quot; When the renomination
came to him, he took it with clean hands and a
clear conscience; and it did come surely and
promptly. The postponers were quenched by general
disapproval; and promptly on the appointed
day, June 7, the Republican Convention met at
Baltimore. As Mr. Forney well said: the body
had not to originate, but simply to republish, a
policy; not to choose a candidate, but only to
adopt the previous choice of the people. Very
wisely the &quot;Radical-union,&quot; or anti-Lincoln, delegation
from Missouri was admitted, as against the
contesting pro-Lincoln delegates. The delegations
from Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana were also
admitted. The President had desired this. Perhaps,
as some people charged, he thought that it
would be a useful precedent for counting the votes
of these States in the election itself, should the
<!-- Image No 281 --><a name='Png281'></a><a name='Page263'></a><span class="pagenum">263</span>Republican party have need to do so. The platform,
besides many other things, declared against
compromise with the rebels; advocated a constitutional
amendment to abolish slavery; and praised
the President and his policy. The first ballot
showed 484 for Lincoln, 22 for Grant. The Missouri
radicals had cast the vote for Grant; they
rose and transferred it to Lincoln, and thus upon
the first ballot he was nominated unanimously.</p>

<p>There was some conflict over the second place.
A numerous body felt, and very properly, that Mr.
Hamlin deserved the approval of renomination.
But others said that policy required the selection
of a war Democrat. The President's advice was
eagerly and persistently sought. Messrs. Nicolay
and Hay allege that he not only ostensibly refused
any response, but that he would give no private
hint; and they say that therefore it was &quot;with
minds absolutely untrammeled by even any knowledge
of the President's wishes, that the convention
went about its work of selecting his associate on
the ticket.&quot; Others assert, and, as it seems to me,
strongly sustain their assertion, that the President
had a distinct and strong purpose in favor of Andrew
Johnson,&mdash;not on personal, but on political
grounds,&mdash;and that it was due to his skillful but
occult interference that the choice ultimately fell
upon the energetic and aggressive war Democrat
of Tennessee.<a name='FNanchor_71_71'></a><a href='#Footnote_71_71'><sup>[71]</sup></a> The first ballot showed for Mr.
<!-- Image No 282 --><a name='Png282'></a><a name='Page264'></a><span class="pagenum">264</span>Johnson 200, for Mr. Hamlin 150, and for Daniel
S. Dickinson, a war Democrat of New York,
108. The nomination of Mr. Johnson was at once
made unanimous.</p>

<p>To the committee who waited upon Mr. Lincoln
to notify him formally of his nomination, he
replied briefly. His only noteworthy remark was
made concerning that clause in the platform which
proposed the constitutional abolition of slavery;
of which he said, that it was &quot;a fitting and necessary
conclusion to the final success of the Union
cause.&quot;</p>

<p>During the ensuing summer of 1864 the strain
to which the nation was subjected was excessive.
The political campaign produced intense excitement,
and the military situation caused profound
anxiety. The Democrats worked as men work
when they anticipate glorious triumph; and even
the Republicans conceded that the chance of their
opponents was alarmingly good. The frightful
conflict which had devoured men and money without
stint was entering upon its fourth year, and
the weary people had not that vision which enabled
the leaders from their watch-tower to see the
end. Wherefore the Democrats, stigmatizing the
war policy as a failure, and crying for peace and a
settlement, held out an alluring purpose, although
they certainly failed to explain distinctly their plan
for achieving this consummation without sacrificing
the Union. Skillfully devoting the summer
to assaults on the Republicans, they awaited the
<!-- Image No 283 --><a name='Png283'></a><a name='Page265'></a><span class="pagenum">265</span>guidance of the latest phase of the political situation
before making their own choice. Then, at
the end of August, their convention nominated
General George B. McClellan. At the time it
seemed probable that the nomination was also the
gift of the office. So unpromising was the outlook
for the Republicans during these summer months
that many leaders, and even the President himself,
felt that their only chance of winning in November
lay in the occurrence before that time of some military
success great enough to convince the people
that it was not yet time to despair of the war.</p>

<p>It was especially hard for the Republicans to
make head against their natural enemies, because
they were so severely handicapped by the bad feeling
and division among themselves. Mr. Wade,
Henry Winter Davis, Thaddeus Stevens, and a
host more, could not do otherwise than accept the
party nominee; yet with what zeal could they work
for the candidate when they felt that they, the
leaders of the party, had been something worse
than ignored in the selection of him? And what
was their influence worth, when all who could be
reached by it knew well their extreme hostility and
distrust towards Mr. Lincoln? Stevens grudgingly
admitted that Lincoln would not be quite so
bad a choice as McClellan, yet let no chance go by
to assail the opinions, measures, and policy of the
Republican President. In this he was imitated
by others, and their reluctant adhesion in the mere
matter of voting the party ticket was much more
<!-- Image No 284 --><a name='Png284'></a><a name='Page266'></a><span class="pagenum">266</span>than offset by this vehemence in condemning the
man in whose behalf they felt it necessary to go
to the polls. In a word the situation was, that
the common soldiers of the party were to go into
the fight under officers who did not expect, and
scarcely desired, to win. Victory is rare under
such circumstances.</p>

<p>The opposition of the Democratic party was
open and legitimate; the unfriendliness of the
Republican politicians was more unfortunate than
unfair, because it was the mistake of sincere and
earnest men. But in the way of Mr. Lincoln's
success there stood still other opponents whose
antagonism was mischievous, insidious, and unfair
both in principle and in detail. Chief in this band
appeared Horace Greeley, with a following and an
influence fluctuating and difficult to estimate, but
considerable. His present political creed was a
strange jumble of Democratic and Republican doctrines.
No Democrat abused the administration
or cried for &quot;peace on almost any terms&quot; louder
than he did; yet he still declaimed against slavery,
and proposed to buy from the South all its slaves
for four hundred millions of dollars. Unfortunately
those of his notions which were of importance
in the pending campaign were the Democratic
ones. If he had come out openly as a free
lance, which was his true character, he would have
less seriously injured the President's cause. This,
however, he would not do, but preferred to fight
against the Republicans in their own camp and
<!-- Image No 285 --><a name='Png285'></a><a name='Page267'></a><span class="pagenum">267</span>wearing their own uniform, and in this guise to
devote all his capacity to embarrassing the man
who was the chosen president and the candidate of
that party. Multitudes in the country had been
wont to accept the editorials of the &quot;Tribune&quot; as
sound political gospels, and the present disaffected
attitude of the variable man who inspired those
vehement writings was a national disaster. He
created and led the party of peace Republicans.
Peace Democracy was a legitimate political doctrine;
but peace Republicanism was an illogical
monstrosity. It lay, with the mortal threat of a
cancer, in the political body of the party. It was
especially unfortunate just at this juncture that
clear thinking was not among Mr. Greeley's gifts.
In single-minded pursuit of his purpose to destroy
Mr. Lincoln by any possible means, he had at first
encouraged the movement for Fremont, though it
was based on views directly contrary to his own.
But soon losing interest in that, he thereafter gave
himself wholly to the business of crying aloud for
immediate peace, which he continued to do throughout
the presidential campaign, always unreasonably,
sometimes disingenuously, but without rest,
and with injurious effect. The vivid picture which
he loved to draw of &quot;our bleeding, bankrupt, and
almost dying country,&quot; longing for peace and
shuddering at the &quot;prospect of new rivers of human
blood,&quot; scared many an honest and anxious
patriot.</p>

<p>In July and August Mr. Greeley was misled
<!-- Image No 286 --><a name='Png286'></a><a name='Page268'></a><span class="pagenum">268</span>into lending himself to the schemes of some Southerners
at Niagara Falls, who threw out intimations
that they were emissaries from the Confederacy
and authorized to treat for peace. He believed
these men, and urged that negotiations should be
prosecuted with them. By the publicity which he
gave to the matter he caused much embarrassment
to Mr. Lincoln, who saw at once that the whole
business was certainly absurd and probably treacherous.
The real purpose of these envoys, he afterwards
said, was undoubtedly &quot;to assist in selecting
and arranging a candidate and a platform for the
Chicago Convention.&quot; Yet clearly as he understood
this false and hollow scheme, he could not
altogether ignore Greeley's demands for attention
to it without giving too much color to those statements
which the editor was assiduously scattering
abroad, to the effect that the administration did
not desire peace, and would not take it when proffered.
So there were reasons why this sham offer
must be treated as if it were an honest one, vexatious
as the necessity appeared to the President.
Perhaps he was cheered by the faith which he had
in the wisdom of proverbs, for now, very fortunately,
he permitted himself to be guided by a
familiar one; and he decided to give to his annoyer
liberal rope. Accordingly he authorized
Mr. Greeley himself to visit in person these emissaries,
to confer with them, and even to bring
them to Washington in case they should prove
really to have from Jefferson Davis any written
<!-- Image No 287 --><a name='Png287'></a><a name='Page269'></a><span class="pagenum">269</span>proposition &quot;for peace, embracing the restoration
of the Union and abandonment of slavery.&quot; It
was an exceedingly shrewd move, and it seriously
discomposed Mr. Greeley, who had not counted
upon being so frankly met, and whose disquietude
was amusingly evident as he reluctantly fluttered
forth to Niagara upon his mission of peace, less
wise than a serpent and unfortunately much less
harmless than a dove.</p>

<p>There is no room here to follow all the intricacies
of the ensuing &quot;negotiations.&quot; The result
was an utter fiasco, fully justifying the President's
opinion of the fatuity of the whole business. The
so-called Southern envoys had no credentials at
all; they appeared to be mere adventurers, and
members of that Southern colony in Canada which
became even more infamous by what it desired to
do than mischievous by what it actually did during
the war. If they had any distinct purpose on
this occasion, it was to injure the Republican party
by discrediting its candidate in precisely the way
in which Mr. Greeley was aiding them to do these
things. But he never got his head sufficiently
clear to appreciate this, and he faithfully continued
to play the part for which he had been cast
by them, but without understanding it. He persistently
charged the responsibility for his bootless
return and ignominious situation upon Mr. Lincoln;
and though his errand proved conclusively
that the South was making no advances,<a name='FNanchor_72_72'></a><a href='#Footnote_72_72'><sup>[72]</sup></a> and
<!-- Image No 288 --><a name='Png288'></a><a name='Page270'></a><span class="pagenum">270</span>though no man in the country was more strictly
affected with personal knowledge of this fact than
he was, yet he continued to tell the people, with
all the weight of his personal authority, that the
President was obstinately set against any and all
proffers of peace. Mr. Lincoln, betwixt mercy
and policy, refrained from crushing his antagonist
by an ungarbled publication of all the facts and
documents; and in return for his forbearance he
long continued to receive from Mr. Greeley vehement
assurances that every direful disaster awaited
the Republican party. The cause suffered much
from these relentless diatribes of the &quot;Tribune's&quot;
influential manager, for nothing else could make
the administration so unpopular as the belief that
it was backward in any possible exertion to secure
an honorable peace.</p>

<p>If by sound logic the Greeley faction should
have voted with the Democrats,&mdash;since in the
chief point in issue, the prosecution of the war,
they agreed with the Democracy,&mdash;so the war
Democrats, being in accord with the Republicans,
upon this same overshadowing issue should, at the
coming election at least, have voted with that
party. Many of them undoubtedly did finally
prefer Lincoln, coupled with Andrew Johnson, to
McClellan. But they also had anxieties, newly
stirred, and entirely reasonable in men of their
political faith. It was plain to them that Mr.
<!-- Image No 289 --><a name='Png289'></a><a name='Page271'></a><span class="pagenum">271</span>Lincoln had been finding his way to the distinct
position that the abolition of slavery was an essential
condition of peace. Now this was undeniably
a very serious and alterative graft upon the original
doctrine that the war was solely for the restoration
of the Union. The editor of a war-Democratic
newspaper in Wisconsin sought information
upon this point. In the course of Mr. Greeley's
negotiatory business Mr. Lincoln had offered to
welcome &quot;any proposition which embraces the
restoration of peace, the integrity of the whole
Union, and the abandonment of slavery.&quot; Now
this, said the interrogating editor, implies &quot;that
no steps can be taken towards peace ... unless
accompanied with an abandonment of slavery.
This puts the whole war question on a new basis
and takes us war Democrats clear off our feet,
leaving us no ground to stand upon. If we sustain
the war and war policy, does it not demand the
changing of our party politics?&quot; Nicolay and
Hay print the draft of a reply by Mr. Lincoln
which, they say, was &quot;apparently unfinished and
probably never sent.&quot; In this he referred to his
past utterances as being still valid. But he said
that no Southerner had &quot;intimated a willingness
for a restoration of the Union in any event or on
any condition whatever.... If Jefferson Davis
wishes for himself, or for the benefit of his friends
at the North, to know what I would do if he were
to offer peace and reunion, saying nothing about
slavery, let him try me.&quot; It must be admitted
<!-- Image No 290 --><a name='Png290'></a><a name='Page272'></a><span class="pagenum">272</span>that this was not an answer, but was a clear waiver
of an answer. The President could not or would
not reply categorically to the queries of the editor.
Perhaps the impossibility of doing so both satisfactorily
and honestly may explain why the paper
was left unfinished and unsent. It was not an easy
letter to write; its composition must have puzzled
one who was always clear both in thought and in
expression. Probably Mr. Lincoln no longer expected
that the end of the war would leave slavery
in existence, nor intended that it should do so;
and doubtless he anticipated that the course of
events would involve the destruction of that now
rotten and undermined institution, without serious
difficulty at the opportune moment. The speeches
made at the Republican nominating convention
had been very outspoken, to the effect that slavery
must be made to &quot;cease forever,&quot; as a result of the
war. Yet a blunt statement that abolition would
be a <i>sine qua non</i> in any arrangements for peace,
emanating directly from the President, as a declaration
of his policy, would be very costly in the
pending campaign, and would imperil rather than
advance the fortunes of him who had this consummation
at heart, and would thereby also diminish
the chance for the consummation itself. So at
last he seems to have left the war Democrats to
puzzle over the conundrum, and decide as best
they could. Of course the doubt affected unfavorably
the votes of some of them.</p>

<p>A measure of the mischief which was done by
<!-- Image No 291 --><a name='Png291'></a><a name='Page273'></a><span class="pagenum">273</span>these suspicions and by Greeley's assertions that
the administration did not desire peace, may be
taken from a letter, written to Mr. Lincoln on
August 22 by Mr. Henry J. Raymond, chairman
of the National Executive Committee of the
Republican party. From all sides, Mr. Raymond
says, &quot;I hear but one report. The tide is setting
strongly against us.&quot; Mr. Washburne, he writes,
despairs of Illinois, and Mr. Cameron of Pennsylvania,
and he himself is not hopeful of New York,
and Governor Morton is doubtful of Indiana;
&quot;and so of the rest.&quot; For this melancholy condition
he assigns two causes: the want of military
successes, and the belief &quot;that we are not to have
peace in any event under this administration until
slavery is abandoned. In some way or other the
suspicion is widely diffused that we can have peace
with union, if we would.&quot; Then even this stanch
Republican leader suggests that it might be good
policy to sound Jefferson Davis on the feasibility
of peace &quot;on the sole condition of acknowledging
the supremacy of the Constitution,&mdash;all other
questions to be settled in a convention of the people
of all the States.&quot; The President might well
have been thrown into inextricable confusion of
mind, betwixt the assaults of avowed enemies, the
denunciations and predictions of inimical friends,
the foolish advice of genuine supporters. It is
now plain that all the counsel which was given to
him was bad, from whatsoever quarter it came. It
shows the powerfulness of his nature that he
<!-- Image No 292 --><a name='Png292'></a><a name='Page274'></a><span class="pagenum">274</span>retained his cool and accurate judgment, although
the crisis was such that even he also had to admit
that the danger of defeat was imminent. To Mr.
Raymond's panic-stricken suggestions he made a
very shrewd response by drafting some instructions
for the purpose of sending that gentleman himself
on the mission to Mr. Davis. It was the same
tactics which he had pursued in dispatching Mr.
Greeley to meet the Southerners in Canada. The
result was that the fruitlessness of the suggestion
was admitted by its author.</p>

<p>As if all hurtful influences were to be concentrated
against the President, it became necessary
just at this inopportune time to make good the terrible
waste in the armies caused by expiration of
terms of service and by the bloody campaigns of
Grant and Sherman. Volunteering was substantially
at an end, and a call for troops would have
to be enforced by a draft. Inevitably this would
stir afresh the hostility of those who dreaded that
the conscription might sweep into military service
themselves or those dear to them. It was Mr.
Lincoln's duty, however, to make the demand, and
to make it at once. He did so; regardless of personal
consequences, he called for 500,000 more
men.</p>

<p>Thus in July and August the surface was covered
with straws, and every one of them indicated
a current setting strongly against Mr. Lincoln.
Unexpectedly the Democratic Convention made a
small counter-eddy; for the peace Democrats, led
<!-- Image No 293 --><a name='Png293'></a><a name='Page275'></a><span class="pagenum">275</span>by Vallandigham, were ill advised enough to force
a peace plank into the platform. This was at once
repudiated by McClellan in his letter of acceptance,
and then again was reiterated by Vallandigham
as the true policy of the party. Thus war
Democrats were alarmed, and a split was opened.
Yet it was by no means such a chasm as that
which, upon the opposite side, divided the radicals
and politicians from the mass of their Republican
comrades. It might affect ratios, but did not seem
likely to change results. In a word, all political
observers now believed that military success was
the only medicine which could help the Republican
prostration, and whether this medicine could be
procured was very doubtful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2>MILITARY SUCCESSES, AND THE RE&Euml;LECTION OF
THE PRESIDENT</h2>

<p>It is necessary now to return to military matters,
and briefly to set forth the situation. No
especial fault was found with General Meade's
operations in Virginia; yet it was obvious that a
system quite different from that which had hitherto
prevailed must be introduced there. To fight a
great battle, then await entire recuperation of
losses, then fight again and wait again, was a process
of lingering exhaustion which might be prolonged
indefinitely. In February, 1864, Congress
passed, though with some reluctance, and the
President much more readily signed, a bill for the
appointment of a lieutenant-general, &quot;authorized,
under the direction and during the pleasure of the
President, to command the armies of the United
States.&quot;<a name='FNanchor_73_73'></a><a href='#Footnote_73_73'><sup>[73]</sup></a> All understood that the place was made
for General Grant, and it was at once given to him
by Mr. Lincoln. On March 3 the appointment
was confirmed by the Senate. By this Halleck
was substantially laid aside; his uselessness had
<!-- Image No 295 --><a name='Png295'></a><a name='Page277'></a><span class="pagenum">277</span>long since become so apparent, that though still
holding his dignified position, he seemed almost
forgotten by every one.</p>

<p>Grant came to Washington,<a name='FNanchor_74_74'></a><a href='#Footnote_74_74'><sup>[74]</sup></a> arriving on March
8, and there was induced by what he heard and
saw to lay aside his own previous purpose and the
strenuous advice of Sherman, and to fall in with
Mr. Lincoln's wishes; that is to say, to take personal
control of the campaign in Virginia. He did
this with his usual promptness, and set Sherman
in command in the middle of the country, the only
other important theatre of operations. It is said
that Grant, before accepting the new rank and
taking Virginia as his special province, stipulated
that he was to be absolutely free from all interference,
especially on the part of Stanton. Whether
this agreement was formulated or not, it was
put into practical effect. No man hereafter interfered
with General Grant. Mr. Lincoln occasionally
made suggestions, but strictly and merely as
suggestions. He distinctly and pointedly said that
he did not know, and did not wish to know, the
general's plans of campaign.<a name='FNanchor_75_75'></a><a href='#Footnote_75_75'><sup>[75]</sup></a> When the new
commander had duly considered the situation, he
adopted precisely the same broad scheme which
had been previously devised by Mr. Lincoln and
General McClellan; that is to say, he arranged a
<!-- Image No 296 --><a name='Png296'></a><a name='Page278'></a><span class="pagenum">278</span>simultaneous vigorous advance all along the line.
It was the way to make weight and numbers tell;
and Grant had great faith in weight and numbers;
like Napoleon, he believed that Providence
has a shrewd way of siding with the heaviest battalions.</p>

<p>On April 30, all being ready for the advance, the
President sent a note of God-speed to the general.
&quot;I wish to express,&quot; he said, &quot;my entire satisfaction
with what you have done up to this time, so
far as I understand it. The particulars of your
plan I neither know, nor seek to know.... If
there is anything wanting which is within my
power to give, do not fail to let me know it.&quot; The
general replied in a pleasant tone: &quot;I have been
astonished at the readiness with which everything
asked for has been yielded, without even an explanation
being asked. Should my success be less
than I desire and expect, the least I can say is,
the fault is not with you.&quot; When the President
read these strange words his astonishment must
have far exceeded that expressed by the general.
Never before had he been thus addressed by any
commander in Virginia! Generally he had been
told that a magnificent success was about to be
achieved, which he had done nothing to promote
and perhaps much to retard, but which would
nevertheless be secured by the ability of a general
in spite of unfriendly neglect by a president.</p>

<p>On May 4 General Grant's army started upon
its way, with 122,146 men present for duty.
<!-- Image No 297 --><a name='Png297'></a><a name='Page279'></a><span class="pagenum">279</span>Against them General Lee had 61,953. The odds
seemed excessive; but Lee had inside lines, the
defensive, and intrenchments, to equalize the disparity
of numbers. At once began those bloody
and incessant campaigns by which General Grant
intended to end, and finally did end, the war.
The North could afford to lose three men where
the South lost two, and would still have a balance
left after the South had spent all. The expenditure
in this proportion would be disagreeable; but
if this was the inevitable and only price, Grant
was willing to pay it, justly regarding it as cheaper
than a continuation of the process of purchase by
piecemeal. In a few hours the frightful struggle
in the Wilderness was in progress. All day on
the 5th, all day on the 6th, the terrible slaughter
continued in those darksome woods and swamps.
&quot;More desperate fighting has not been witnessed
on this continent,&quot; said Grant. The Union troops
could not force their way through those tangled
forests. Thereupon, accepting the situation in
his imperturbable way, he arranged to move, on
May 7, by the left flank southerly towards Spottsylvania.
Lee, disappointed and surprised that
Grant was advancing instead of falling back, could
not do otherwise than move in the same course;
for, in fact, the combatants were locked together
in a grappling campaign. Then took place more
bloody and determined fighting. The Union
losses were appalling, since the troops were attacking
an army in position. Yet Grant was sanguine;
<!-- Image No 298 --><a name='Png298'></a><a name='Page280'></a><span class="pagenum">280</span>it was in a dispatch of May 11 that he said that
he had been getting the better in the struggle, and
that he proposed to fight it out on that line if it
took all summer. The result of the further slaughter
at Spottsylvania was not a victory for either
leader, but was more hurtful to Lee because he
could less well afford to have his men killed and
wounded. Grant, again finding that he could not
force Lee out of his position, also again moved by
the left flank, steadily approaching Richmond and
dragging Lee with him. The Northern loss had
already reached the frightful total of 37,335 men;
the Confederate loss was less, but enormous.
Amid the bloodshed, however, Grant scented success.
On May 26 he wrote: &quot;Lee's army is really
whipped.... Our men feel that they have gained
the morale over the enemy.... I may be mistaken,
but I feel that our success over Lee's army
is already assured.&quot; He even gratified the President
by again disregarding all precedent in Virginian
campaigns, and saying that the promptness
with which reinforcements had been forwarded
had contributed largely to the promising situation!
But almost immediately after this the North shuddered
at the enormous and profitless carnage at
Cold Harbor. Concurrently with all this bloodshed,
there also took place the famous and ill-starred
movement of General Butler upon Richmond,
which ended in securely shutting up him and
his forces at Bermuda Hundred, &quot;as in a bottle
strongly corked.&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Image No 299 --><a name='Png299'></a><a name='Page281'></a><span class="pagenum">281</span>
Such was the Virginian situation early in June.
By a series of most bloody battles, no one of which
had been a real victory, Grant had come before
the defenses of Richmond, nearly where McClellan
had already been. And now, like McClellan, he
proposed to move around to the southward and
invest the city. It must be confessed that in all
this there was nothing visible to the inexperienced
vision of the citizens at home which made much
brighter in their eyes the prestige of Mr. Lincoln's
war policy. Nor could they see, as that summer
of the presidential campaign came and went, that
any really great change or improvement was
effected.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there took place in July
what is sometimes lightly called General Early's
raid against Washington. In fact, it was a genuine
and very serious campaign, wherein that general
was within a few hours of capturing the city.
Issuing out of that Shenandoah Valley whence, as
from a cave of horrors rather than one of the loveliest
valleys in the world, so much of terror and
mischief had so often burst out against the North,
Early, with 17,000 veteran troops, moved straight
and fast upon the national capital. On the evening
of July 10 Mr. Lincoln rode out to his summer
quarters at the Soldiers' Home. But the Confederate
troops were within a few miles, and Mr.
Stanton insisted that he should come back. The
next day the Confederates advanced along the
Seventh Street road, in full expectation of marching
<!-- Image No 300 --><a name='Png300'></a><a name='Page282'></a><span class="pagenum">282</span>
into the city with little opposition. There was
brisk artillery firing, and Mr. Lincoln, who had
driven out to the scene of action, actually came
under fire; an officer was struck down within a
few feet of him.</p>

<p>The anticipation of General Early was sanguine,
yet by no means ill founded. The veterans in
Washington were a mere handful, and though the
green troops might have held the strong defenses
for a little while, yet the Southern veterans would
have been pretty sure to make their way. It was,
in fact, a very close question of time. Grant had
been at first incredulous of the reports of Early's
movements; but when he could no longer doubt,
he sent reinforcements with the utmost dispatch.
They arrived none too soon. It was while General
Early was making his final arrangements for an
attack, which he meant should be irresistible, that
General Wright, with two divisions from the army
of the Potomac, landed at the river wharves and
marched through the city to the threatened points.
With this the critical hours passed away. It had
really been a crisis of hours, and might have been
one of minutes. Now Early saw that the prize
had slipped through his fingers actually as they
closed upon it, and so bitter was his disappointment
that&mdash;since he was disappointed&mdash;even a
Northerner can almost afford him sympathy. So,
his chance being gone, he must go too, and that
speedily; for it was he who was in danger now.
Moving rapidly, he saved himself, and returned up
<!-- Image No 301 --><a name='Png301'></a><a name='Page283'></a><span class="pagenum">283</span>the Shenandoah Valley. He had accomplished no
real harm; but that the war had been going on for
three years, and that Washington was still hardly
a safe place for the President to live in, was another
point against the war policy.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Sherman had moved out against Johnston, at
Dalton, at the same time that Grant had moved
out against Lee, and during the summer he made
a record very similar to that of his chief. He
pressed the enemy without rest, fought constantly,
suffered and inflicted terrible losses, won no signal
victory, yet constantly got farther to the southward.
Fortunately, however, he was nearer to a
specific success than Grant was, and at last he was
able to administer the sorely needed tonic to the
political situation. Jefferson Davis, who hated
Johnston, made the steady retreat of that general
before Sherman an excuse for removing him and
putting General Hood in his place. The army
was then at Atlanta. Hood was a fighting man,
and immediately he brought on a great battle,
which happily proved to be also a great mistake;
for the result was a brilliant and decisive victory
for Sherman and involved the fall of Atlanta.
This was one of the important achievements of the
war; and when, on September 3, Sherman telegraphed,
&quot;Atlanta is ours, and fairly won,&quot; the
news came to the President like wine to the weary.
He hastened to tender the &quot;national thanks&quot; to
the general and his gallant soldiers, with words of
<!-- Image No 302 --><a name='Png302'></a><a name='Page284'></a><span class="pagenum">284</span>gratitude which must have come straight and warm
from his heart. There was a chance now for the
Union cause in November.</p>

<p>About ten days before this event Farragut, in
spite of forts and batteries, iron-clads and torpedoes,
had possessed himself of Mobile Bay and
closed that Gulf port which had been so useful a
mouth to the hungry stomach of the Confederacy.
No efficient blockade of it had ever been possible.
Through it military, industrial, and domestic supplies
had been brought in, and invaluable cotton
had gone out to pay for them. Now, however, the
sealing of the South was all but hermetical. As
a naval success the feat was entitled to high admiration,
and as a practical injury to the Confederacy
it could not be overestimated.</p>

<p>Achievements equally brilliant, if not quite so
important, were quickly contributed by Sheridan.
In spite of objections on the part of Stanton,
Grant had put this enterprising fighter in command
of a strong force of cavalry in the Shenandoah
Valley, where Lee was keeping Early as a
constant menace upon Maryland, Pennsylvania,
and Washington. Three hard-fought battles followed,
during September and October. In each
the Federals were thoroughly victorious. The last
of the three was that which was made famous by
&quot;Sheridan's ride.&quot; He had been to Washington
and was returning on horseback, when to his surprise
he encountered squads of his own troops
hurrying back in disorderly flight from a battle
<!-- Image No 303 --><a name='Png303'></a><a name='Page285'></a><span class="pagenum">285</span>which, during his brief absence, had unexpectedly
been delivered by Early. Halting them and carrying
them back with him, he was relieved, as he
came upon the field, to find a part of his army still
standing firm and even pressing the Confederates
hard. He communicated his own spirit to his
troops, and turned partial defeat into brilliant victory.
By this gallant deed was shattered forever
the Confederate Army of the Valley; and from
that time forth there issued out of that fair concealment
no more gray-uniformed troopers to foray
Northern fields or to threaten Northern towns.
For these achievements Lincoln made Sheridan a
major-general, dictating the appointment in words
of unusual compliment.</p>

<p>Late as the Democrats were in holding their
nominating convention, they would have done well
to hold it a little later. They might then have
derived wisdom from these military and naval
events, and not improbably they would have been
less audacious in staking their success upon the
issue that the war was a failure, and would have
so modified that craven proposition as to make it
accord with the more patriotic sentiment of their
soldier candidate. But the fortunes alike of the
real war and of the political war were decidedly
and happily against them. Even while they were
in session the details of Farragut's daring and
victorious battle in Mobile Bay were coming to
hand. Scarcely had they adjourned when the roar
of thunderous salvos in every navy yard, fort, and
<!-- Image No 304 --><a name='Png304'></a><a name='Page286'></a><span class="pagenum">286</span>arsenal of the North hailed the triumph of Sherman
at Atlanta. Before these echoes had died
away the people were electrified by the three battles
in Virginia which Sheridan fought and won
in style so brilliant as to seem almost theatrical.
Thus from the South, from the West, and from
the East came simultaneously the fierce contradiction
of this insulting Copperhead notion, that the
North had failed in the war. The political blunder
of the party was now much more patent than
was any alleged military failure on the part of its
opponents. In fact the Northerners were beholding
the sudden turning over of a great page in the
book of the national history, and upon the newly
exposed side of it, amid the telegrams announcing
triumphs of arms, they read in great plain letters
the re&euml;lection of Mr. Lincoln. Before long most
persons conceded this. He himself had said, a few
months earlier, that the probabilities indicated
that the presidential campaign would be a struggle
between a Union candidate and a Disunion candidate.
McClellan had sought to give to it a complexion
safer for his party and more honorable for
himself, but the platform and events combined
to defeat his wise purpose. In addition to these
difficulties the South also burdened him with an
untimely and compromising friendship. The
Charleston &quot;Courier,&quot; with reckless frankness,
declared that the armies of the Confederacy and
the peace-men at the North were working together
for the procurement of peace; and said: &quot;Our
<!-- Image No 305 --><a name='Png305'></a><a name='Page287'></a><span class="pagenum">287</span>success in battle insures the success of McClellan.
Our failure will inevitably lead to his defeat.&quot; No
words could have been more imprudent; the loud
proclamation of such an alliance was the madness
of self-destruction. In the face of such talk
the Northerners could not but believe that the
issue was truly made up between war and Union
on the one side, peace and disunion on the other.
If between the two, when distinctly formulated,
there could under any circumstances have been
doubt, the successes by sea and land turned the
scale for the Republicans.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>During the spring and summer many prominent
Republicans strenuously urged Mr. Lincoln to
remove the postmaster-general, Montgomery Blair,
from the cabinet. The political purpose was to
placate the Radicals, whose unnatural hostility
within the party greatly disturbed the President's
friends. Many followers of Fremont might be
conciliated by the elimination of the bitter and
triumphant opponent of their beloved chieftain;
and besides this leader, the portentous list of those
with whom the postmaster was on ill terms included
many magnates,&mdash;Chase, Seward, Stanton, Halleck,
and abundance of politicians. Henry Wilson
wrote to the President: &quot;Blair every one hates.
Tens of thousands of men will be lost to you, or
will give a reluctant vote, on account of the Blairs.&quot;
Even the Republican National Convention had
covertly assailed him; for a plank in the platform,
<!-- Image No 306 --><a name='Png306'></a><a name='Page288'></a><span class="pagenum">288</span>declaring it &quot;essential to the general welfare that
harmony should prevail in the national councils,&quot;
was known to mean that he should no longer remain
in the cabinet. Yet to force him out was
most distasteful to the President, who was always
slow to turn against any man. Replying to a
denunciatory letter from Halleck he said: &quot;I propose
continuing to be myself the judge as to when
a member of the cabinet shall be dismissed.&quot; He
made a like statement, curtly and decisively, in a
cabinet meeting. Messrs. Nicolay and Hay say
that he did not yield to the pressure until he was
assured of his re&euml;lection, and that then he yielded
only because he felt that he ought not obstinately
to retain an adviser in whom the party had lost
confidence. On September 23 he wrote to Mr.
Blair a kindly note: &quot;You have generously said
to me more than once that whenever your resignation
could be a relief to me, it was at my disposal.
The time has come. You very well know that this
proceeds from no dissatisfaction of mine with you,
personally or officially. Your uniform kindness
has been unsurpassed by that of any friend.&quot; Mr.
Blair immediately relieved the President from the
embarrassing situation, and he and his family
behaved afterward with honorable spirit, giving
loyal support to Mr. Lincoln during the rest of the
campaign. Ex-Governor Dennison of Ohio was
appointed to the vacant office.</p>

M. Blair.
</p>

<p>Many and various were the other opportunities
which the President was urged to seize for helping
<!-- Image No 307 --><a name='Png307'></a>
<!-- Image No 308 --><a name='Png308'></a>
<!-- Image No 309 --><a name='Png309'></a><a name='Page289'></a><span class="pagenum">289</span>
both himself and other Republican candidates.
But he steadfastly declined to get into the mud of
the struggle. It was a jest of the campaign that
Senator King was sent by some New York men to
ask whether Lincoln meant to support the Republican
ticket. He did: he openly admitted that he
believed his re&euml;lection to be for the best interest of
the country. As an honest man he could not think
otherwise. &quot;I am for the regular nominee in all
cases,&quot; he bluntly said, in reply to a request for
his interference concerning a member of Congress;
and the general principle covered, of course, his
own case. To the postmaster of Philadelphia,
however, whose employees displayed suspicious
Republican unanimity, he administered a sharp
and imperious warning. He even would not extend
to his close and valued friend, Mr. Arnold,
assistance which that gentleman too sorely needed.
More commendable still was his behavior as to
the draft. On July 18, as has been said, he issued
a call for 500,000 men, though at that time he
might well have believed that by so doing he was
burying beyond resurrection all chance of re&euml;lection.
Later the Republican leaders entreated him,
with earnest eloquence and every melancholy
presage, to suspend the drafting under this call
for a few weeks only. It seemed to him, however,
that the army could not wait a few weeks.
&quot;What is the presidency worth to me, if I have
no country?&quot; he said; and the storm of persuasion
could not induce him to issue the postponing order.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 310 --><a name='Png310'></a><a name='Page290'></a><span class="pagenum">290</span>
Campaign slanders were rife as usual. One of
them Mr. Lincoln cared to contradict. Some
remarks made by Mr. Seward in a speech at
Auburn had been absurdly construed by Democratic
orators and editors to indicate that Mr. Lincoln,
if defeated at the polls, would use the remainder
of his term for doing what he could to
ruin the government. This vile charge, silly as
it was, yet touched a very sensitive spot. On
October 19, in a speech to some serenaders, and
evidently having this in mind, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I am struggling to maintain the government,
not to overthrow it. I am struggling especially
to prevent others from overthrowing it....
Whoever shall be constitutionally elected in November
shall be duly installed as President on the
fourth of March.... In the interval I shall do
my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for
the next voyage shall start with the best possible
chance to save the ship. This is due to the people
both on principle and under the Constitution....
If they should deliberately resolve to have immediate
peace, even at the loss of their country and
their liberty, I know [have?] not the power or
the right to resist them. It is their business, and
they must do as they please with their own.&quot;</p>

<p>In this connection it is worth while to recall
an incident which occurred on August 26, amid
the dark days. Anticipating at that time that
he might soon be compelled to encounter the sore
trial of administering the government during four
<!-- Image No 311 --><a name='Png311'></a><a name='Page291'></a><span class="pagenum">291</span>months in face of its near transmission to a successor
all whose views and purposes would be
diametrically opposite to his own, and desiring
beforehand clearly to mark out his duty in this
stress, Mr. Lincoln one day wrote these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;This morning, as for some days past, it seems
exceedingly probable that this administration will
not be re&euml;lected. Then it will be my duty to so
cooperate with the President-elect as to save the
Union between the election and the inauguration,
as he will have secured his election on such ground
that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p>He then closed the paper so that it could not be
read, and requested each member of the cabinet
to sign his name on the reverse side.</p>

<p>In the end, honesty was vindicated as the best
policy, and courage as the soundest judgment.
The preliminary elections in Vermont and Maine
in September, the important elections in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, and Indiana in October, showed
that a Republican wave was sweeping across the
North. It swept on and gathered overwhelming
volume in the brief succeeding interval before
November 8. On that momentous day, the voting
in the States showed 2,213,665 Republican
votes, to which were added 116,887 votes of soldiers
in the field, electing 212 presidential electors;
1,802,237 Democratic votes, to which were added
33,748 votes of soldiers in the field, electing 21
presidential electors. Mr. Lincoln's plurality was
therefore 494,567; and it would have been swelled
<!-- Image No 312 --><a name='Png312'></a><a name='Page292'></a><span class="pagenum">292</span>to over half a million had not the votes of the
soldiers of Vermont, Kansas, and Minnesota arrived
too late to be counted, and had not those of
Wisconsin been rejected for an informality. Thus
were the dreary predictions of the midsummer so
handsomely confuted that men refused to believe
that they had ever been deceived by them.</p>

<p>On the evening of election day Mr. Lincoln
went to the War Department, and there stayed
until two o'clock at night, noting the returns as
they came assuring his triumph and steadily swelling
its magnitude. Amid the good news his feelings
took on no personal complexion. A crowd
of serenaders, meeting him on his return to the
White House, demanded a speech. He told them
that he believed that the day's work would be the
lasting advantage, if not the very salvation, of the
country, and that he was grateful for the people's
confidence; but, he said, &quot;if I know my heart,
my gratitude is free from any taint of personal
triumph. I do not impugn the motives of any
one opposed to me. It is no pleasure to me to
triumph over any one; but I give thanks to the
Almighty for this evidence of the people's resolution
to stand by free government and the rights of
humanity.&quot; A hypocrite would, probably enough,
have said much the same thing; but when Mr.
Lincoln spoke in this way, men who were themselves
honest never charged him with hypocrisy.
On November 10 a serenade by the Republican
clubs of the District called forth this:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Image No 313 --><a name='Png313'></a><a name='Page293'></a><span class="pagenum">293</span>
&quot;It has long been a grave question whether any
government, not too strong for the liberties of its
people, can be strong enough to maintain its own
existence in great emergencies. On this point the
present rebellion brought our republic to a severe
test, and a presidential election occurring in regular
course during the rebellion added not a little
to the strain. If the loyal people united were put
to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion,
must they not fail when divided and partially
paralyzed by a political war among themselves?
But the election was a necessity. We cannot have
free government without elections; and if the
rebellion could force us to forego or postpone a
national election, it might fairly claim to have
already conquered and ruined us. The strife of
the election is but human nature practically applied
to the facts of the case. What has occurred in
this case must ever recur in similar cases. Human
nature will not change. In any future great
national trial, compared with the men of this, we
shall have as weak and as strong, as silly and as
wise, as bad and as good. Let us, therefore,
study the incidents of this, as philosophy to learn
wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be
revenged. But the election, along with its incidental
and undesirable strife, has done good, too.
It has demonstrated that a people's government
can sustain a national election in the midst of a
great civil war. Until now, it has not been
known to the world that this was a possibility. It
<!-- Image No 314 --><a name='Png314'></a><a name='Page294'></a><span class="pagenum">294</span>shows, also, how sound and how strong we still
are. It shows that, even among candidates of the
same party, he who is most devoted to the Union
and most opposed to treason can receive most of
the people's votes. It shows, also, to the extent
yet known, that we have more men now than we
had when the war began. Gold is good in its
place; but living, brave, patriotic men are better
than gold.</p>

<p>&quot;But the rebellion continues; and, now that the
election is over, may not all having a common
interest reunite in a common effort to save our
common country? For my own part, I have
striven and shall strive to avoid placing any
obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here,
I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's
bosom. While I am deeply sensible to the high
compliment of a re&euml;lection, and duly grateful, as
I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my
countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for
their own good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction
that any other man may be disappointed or pained
by the result.</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask those who have not differed with
me to join with me in this same spirit towards
those who have? And now let me close by asking
three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen,
and their gallant and skillful commanders.&quot;</p>

<p>The unfortunate disputes about reconstruction
threatened to cause trouble at the counting of the
<!-- Image No 315 --><a name='Png315'></a><a name='Page295'></a><span class="pagenum">295</span>votes in Congress. Of the States which had
seceded, two, Arkansas and Tennessee, had endeavored
to reconstruct themselves as members of
the Union; and their renewed statehood had received
some recognition from the President. He,
however, firmly refused to listen to demands, which
were urgently pushed, to obtain his interference in
the arrangements made for choosing presidential
electors. To certain Tennesseeans, who sent him
a protest against the action of Governor Johnson,
he replied that, &quot;by the Constitution and the
laws, the President is charged with no duty in the
conduct of a presidential election in any State;
nor do I in this case perceive any military reason
for his interference in the matter.... It is
scarcely necessary to add that if any election shall
be held, and any votes shall be cast, in the State
of Tennessee, ... it will belong not to the military
agents, nor yet to the executive department,
but exclusively to another department of the government,
to determine whether they are entitled
to be counted, in conformity with the Constitution
and laws of the United States.&quot; His prudent
abstention from stretching his official authority
afterward saved him from much embarrassment
in the turn which this troublesome business soon
took. In both Arkansas and Tennessee Republican
presidential electors were chosen, who voted,
and sent on to Washington the certificates of their
votes to be counted in due course with the rest.
But Congress jealously guarded its position on
<!-- Image No 316 --><a name='Png316'></a><a name='Page296'></a><span class="pagenum">296</span>reconstruction against this possible flank movement,
and in January, 1865, passed a joint resolution
declaring that Virginia, North and South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee were
in such a condition on November 8 that no valid
election of presidential electors was held in any of
them, and that therefore no electoral votes should
be received or counted from any of them. When
this resolution came before Mr. Lincoln for his
signature it placed him in an embarrassing position,
because his approval might seem to be an
implied contradiction of the position which he had
taken concerning the present status of Tennessee
and Arkansas. It was not until February 8, the
very day of the count, that he conquered his
reluctance, and when at last he did so and decided
to sign the resolution, he at the same time carefully
made his position plain by a brief message.
He said that he conceived that Congress had lawful
power to exclude from the count any votes
which it deemed illegal, and that therefore he
could not properly veto a joint resolution upon the
subject; he disclaimed &quot;all right of the executive
to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing
or counting electoral votes;&quot; and he also disclaimed
that, by signing the resolution, he had
&quot;expressed any opinion on the recitals of the
preamble, or any judgment of his own upon the
subject of the resolution.&quot; That is to say, the
especial matter dealt with in this proceeding was
<!-- Image No 317 --><a name='Png317'></a><a name='Page297'></a><span class="pagenum">297</span><i>ultra vires</i> of the executive, and the formal signature
of the President was affixed by him without
prejudice to his official authority in any other
business which might arise concerning the restored
condition of statehood.</p>

<p>When the counting of the votes began, the
members of the Senate and House did not know
whether Mr. Lincoln had signed the resolution or
not; and therefore, in the doubt as to what his
action would be, the famous twenty-second joint
rule, regulating the counting of electoral votes,
was drawn in haste and passed with precipitation.<a name='FNanchor_76_76'></a><a href='#Footnote_76_76'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
It was an instance of angry partisan legislation,
which threatened trouble afterward and was useless
at the time. No attempt was made to present
or count the votes of Arkansas and Tennessee, and
the president of the Senate acted under the joint
resolution and not under the joint rule. Yet the
vote of West Virginia was counted, and it was not
easy to show that her title was not under a legal
cloud fully as dark as that which shadowed
Arkansas and Tennessee.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>When Mr. Lincoln said concerning his re&euml;lection,
that the element of personal triumph gave
him no gratification, he spoke far within the
<!-- Image No 318 --><a name='Png318'></a><a name='Page298'></a><span class="pagenum">298</span>truth. He was not boasting of, but only in an
unintentional way displaying, his dispassionate
and impersonal habit in all political relationships,&mdash;a
distinguishing trait, of which history is so
chary of parallels that perhaps no reader will
recall even one. A striking instance of it occurred
in this same autumn. On October 12, 1864, the
venerable Chief Justice Taney died, and at once
the friends of Mr. Chase named him for the succession.
There were few men whom Mr. Lincoln
had less reason to favor than this gentleman, who
had only condescended to mitigate severe condemnation
of his capacity by mild praise of his character,
who had hoped to displace him from the
presidency, and who, in the effort to do so, had
engaged in what might have been stigmatized even
as a cabal. Plenty of people were ready to tell
him stories innumerable of Chase's hostility to
him, and contemptuous remarks about him; but
to all such communications he quietly refused to
give ear. What Mr. Chase thought or felt concerning
him was not pertinent to the question
whether or no Chase would make a good chief
justice. Yet it was true that Montgomery Blair
would have liked the place, and the President had
many personal reasons for wishing to do a favor
to Blair. It was also true that the opposition to
Mr. Chase was so bitter and came from so many
quarters, and was based on so many alleged reasons,
that had the President chosen to prefer
another to him, it would have been impossible to
<!-- Image No 319 --><a name='Png319'></a><a name='Page299'></a><span class="pagenum">299</span>attribute the preference to personal prejudice. In
his own mind, however, Mr. Lincoln really believed
that, in spite of all the objections which
could be made, Mr. Chase was the best man for
the position; and his only anxiety was that one so
restless and ambitious might still scheme for the
presidency to the inevitable prejudice of his judicial
duties. He had some thought of speaking
frankly with Chase on this subject, perhaps seeking
something like a pledge from him; but he was
deterred from this by fear of misconstruction.
Finally having, after his usual fashion, reached
his own conclusion, and communicated it to no
one, he sent the nomination to the Senate, and it
received the honor of immediate confirmation without
reference to a committee.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2>THE END COMES INTO SIGHT: THE SECOND
INAUGURATION</h2>

<p>When Congress came together in December,
1864, the doom of the Confederacy was in plain
view of all men, at the North and at the South.
If General Grant had sustained frightful losses
without having won any signal victory, yet the
losses could be afforded; and the nature of the
man and his methods in warfare were now understood.
It was seen that, with or without victory,
and at whatever cost, he had moved relentlessly
forward. His grim, irresistible persistence oppressed,
as with a sense of destiny, those who tried
to confront it; every one felt that he was going to
&quot;end the job.&quot; He was now beleaguering Petersburg,
and few Southerners doubted that he was
sure of taking it and Richmond. In the middle
country Sherman, after taking Atlanta, had soon
thereafter marched cheerily forth on his imposing,
theatrical, holiday excursion to the sea, leaving
General Thomas behind him to do the hard fighting
with General Hood. The grave doubt as to
whether too severe a task had not been placed upon
Thomas was dispelled by the middle of the month,
<!-- Image No 321 --><a name='Png321'></a><a name='Page301'></a><span class="pagenum">301</span>when his brilliant victory at Nashville so shattered
the Southern army that it never again attained
important proportions. In June preceding, the
notorious destroyer, the Alabama, had been sunk
by the Kearsarge. In November the Shenandoah,
the last of the rebel privateers, came into Liverpool,
and was immediately handed over by the
British authorities to Federal officials; for the
Englishmen had at last found out who was going
to win in the struggle. In October, the rebel
ram Albemarle was destroyed by the superb gallantry
of Lieutenant Cushing. Thus the rebel
flag ceased to fly above any deck. Along the coast
very few penetrable crevices could still be found
even by the most enterprising blockade-runners;
and already the arrangements were making which
brought about, a month later, the capture of Fort
Fisher and Wilmington.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the desire to precipitate
the pace and to reach the end with a rush
possessed many persons of the nervous and eager
type. They could not spur General Grant, so they
gave their vexatious attention to the President,
and endeavored to compel him to open with the
Confederate government negotiations for a settlement,
which they believed, or pretended to believe,
might thus be attained. But Mr. Lincoln was
neither to be urged nor wheedled out of his simple
position. In his message to Congress he referred
to the number of votes cast at the recent election
as indicating that, in spite of the drain of war,
<!-- Image No 322 --><a name='Png322'></a><a name='Page302'></a><span class="pagenum">302</span>the population of the North had actually increased
during the preceding four years. This fact shows,
he said, &quot;that we are not exhausted nor in process
of exhaustion; that we are <i>gaining</i> strength,
and may, if need be, maintain the contest indefinitely.
This as to men. Material resources are
now more complete and abundant than ever. The
natural resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as
we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to
re&euml;stablish and maintain the national authority
is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable.
The manner of continuing the effort remains to
choose. On careful consideration of all the evidence
accessible, it seems to me that no attempt at
negotiation with the insurgent leader could result
in any good. He would accept nothing short of
severance of the Union,&mdash;precisely what we will
not and cannot give. His declarations to this
effect are explicit and oft-repeated. He does not
attempt to deceive us. He affords us no excuse
to deceive ourselves. He cannot voluntarily re-accept
the Union; we cannot voluntarily yield it.
Between him and us the issue is distinct, simple,
and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be
tried by war, and decided by victory. If we yield,
we are beaten; if the Southern people fail him, he
is beaten. Either way, it would be the victory and
defeat following war.</p>

<p>&quot;What is true, however, of him who heads the
insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those
who follow. Although he cannot re-accept the
<!-- Image No 323 --><a name='Png323'></a><a name='Page303'></a><span class="pagenum">303</span>Union, they can; some of them, we know, already
desire peace and reunion. The number of such
may increase. They can at any moment have
peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting
to the national authority under the Constitution.</p>

<p>&quot;After so much, the government could not, if
it would, maintain war against them. The loyal
people would not sustain or allow it. If questions
should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful
means of legislation, conference, courts, and
votes, operating only in constitutional and lawful
channels. Some certain, and other possible, questions
are, and would be, beyond the executive
power to adjust,&mdash;as, for instance, the admission
of members into Congress, and whatever might
require the appropriation of money.</p>

<p>&quot;The executive power itself would be greatly
diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons
and remissions of forfeitures, however, would
still be within executive control. In what spirit
and temper this control would be exercised can be
fairly judged of by the past.&quot;</p>

<p>If rebels wished to receive, or any Northerners
wished to extend, a kindlier invitation homeward
than this, then such rebels and such Northerners
were unreasonable. Very soon the correctness of
Mr. Lincoln's opinion was made so distinct, and
his view of the situation was so thoroughly corroborated,
that all men saw clearly that no reluctance
or unreasonable demands upon his part
<!-- Image No 324 --><a name='Png324'></a><a name='Page304'></a><span class="pagenum">304</span>contributed to delay peace. Mr. Francis P. Blair,
senior, though in pursuit of a quite different
object, did the service of setting the President in
the true and satisfactory light before the people.
This restless politician was anxious for leave to
seek a conference with Jefferson Davis, but could
not induce Mr. Lincoln to hear a word as to his
project. On December 8, however, by personal
insistence, he extorted a simple permit &quot;to pass
our lines, go South, and return.&quot; He immediately
set out on his journey, and on January 12 he had
an interview with Mr. Davis at Richmond and
made to him a most extraordinary proposition,
temptingly decorated with abundant flowers of
rhetoric. Without the rhetoric, the proposition
was: that the pending war should be dropped by
both parties for the purpose of an expedition to
expel Maximilian from Mexico, of which tropical
crusade Mr. Davis should be in charge and reap
the glory! So ardent and so sanguine was Mr.
Blair in his absurd project, that he fancied that he
had impressed Mr. Davis favorably. But in this
undoubtedly he deceived himself, for in point of
fact he succeeded in bringing back nothing more
than a short letter, addressed to himself, in which
Mr. Davis expressed willingness to appoint and
send, or to receive, agents &quot;with a view to secure
peace to the two countries.&quot; The last two words
lay in this rebel communication like the twin
venom fangs in the mouth of a serpent, and made
of it a proposition which could not safely be
<!-- Image No 325 --><a name='Png325'></a><a name='Page305'></a><span class="pagenum">305</span>touched. It served only as distinct proof that the
President had correctly stated the fixedness of Mr.
Davis.</p>

<p>Of more consequence, however, than this useless
letter was the news which Mr. Blair brought:
that other high officials in Richmond&mdash;&quot;those
who follow,&quot; as Mr. Lincoln had hopefully said&mdash;were
in a temper far more despondent and yielding
than was that of their chief. These men might
be reached. So on January 18, 1865, Mr. Lincoln
wrote a few lines, also addressed to Mr. Blair,
saying that he was ready to receive any Southern
agent who should be informally sent to him, &quot;with
the view of securing peace to the people of our
one common country.&quot; The two letters, by their
closing words, locked horns. Yet Mr. Davis nominated
Alexander H. Stephens, R.M.T. Hunter,
and John A. Campbell, as informal commissioners,
and directed them, &quot;in conformity with
the letter of Mr. Lincoln,&quot; to go to Washington
and informally confer &quot;for the purpose of
securing peace to the two countries.&quot; This was
disingenuous, and so obviously so that it was also
foolish; for no conference about &quot;two countries&quot;
was &quot;in conformity&quot; with the letter of Mr. Lincoln.
By reason of the difficulty created by this
silly trick the commissioners were delayed at General
Grant's headquarters until they succeeded in
concocting a note, which eliminated the obstacle
by the simple process of omitting the objectionable
words. Then, on January 31, the President sent
<!-- Image No 326 --><a name='Png326'></a><a name='Page306'></a><span class="pagenum">306</span>Mr. Seward to meet them, stating to him in writing
&quot;that three things are indispensable, to wit:
1. The restoration of the national authority
throughout all the States. 2. No receding by the
executive of the United States on the slavery
question from the position assumed thereon in the
late annual message to Congress, and in preceding
documents. 3. No cessation of hostilities short of
an end of the war and the disbanding of all forces
hostile to the government. You will inform them
that all propositions of theirs, not inconsistent
with the above, will be considered and passed upon
in a spirit of sincere liberality. You will hear all
they may choose to say, and report it to me. You
will not assume to definitely consummate anything.&quot;</p>

<p>The following day Mr. Lincoln seemed to become
uneasy at being represented by any other
person whomsoever in so important a business;
for he decided to go himself and confer personally
with the Southerners. Then ensued, and continued
during four hours, on board a steamer in
Hampton Roads, the famous conference between
the President and his secretary of state on the one
side and the three Confederate commissioners on
the other. It came to absolutely nothing; nor was
there at any time pending its continuance any
chance that it would come to anything. Mr. Lincoln
could neither be led forward nor cajoled sideways,
directly or indirectly, one step from the
primal condition of the restoration of the Union.
<!-- Image No 327 --><a name='Png327'></a><a name='Page307'></a><span class="pagenum">307</span>On the other hand, this was the one impossible
thing for the Confederates. The occasion was
historic, and yet, in fact, it amounted to nothing
more than cumulative evidence of a familiar fact,
and really its most interesting feature is that it
gave rise to one of the best of the &quot;Lincoln stories.&quot;
The President was persisting that he could
not enter into any agreement with &quot;parties in arms
against the government;&quot; Mr. Hunter tried to
persuade him to the contrary, and by way of doing
so, cited precedents &quot;of this character between
Charles I. of England and the people in arms
against him.&quot; Mr. Lincoln could not lose such an
opportunity! &quot;I do not profess,&quot; he said, &quot;to be
posted in history. On all such matters I will turn
you over to Seward. All I distinctly recollect
about the case of Charles I. is, <i>that he lost his
head!&quot;</i> Then silence fell for a time upon Mr.
Hunter.</p>

<p>Across the wide chasm of the main question the
gentlemen discussed the smaller topics: reconstruction,
concerning which Mr. Lincoln expressed
his well-known, most generous sentiments; confiscation
acts, as to which also he desired to be,
and believed that Congress would be, liberal; the
Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth
Amendment, concerning which he said, that the
courts of law must construe the proclamation, and
that he personally should be in favor of appropriating
even so much as four hundred millions of
dollars to extinguish slavery, and that he believed
<!-- Image No 328 --><a name='Png328'></a><a name='Page308'></a><span class="pagenum">308</span>such a measure might be carried through. West
Virginia, in his opinion, must continue to be a
separate State. Yet there was little practical use
in discussing, and either agreeing or disagreeing,
about all these dependent parts; they were but
limbs which it was useless to set in shape while
the body was lacking. Accordingly the party
broke up, not having found, nor having ever had
any prospect of finding, any common standing-ground.
The case was simple; the North was
fighting for Union, the South for disunion, and
neither side was yet ready to give up the struggle.
Nevertheless, it is not improbable that Mr.
Lincoln, so far as he personally was concerned,
brought back from Hampton Roads all that he
had expected and precisely what he had hoped to
bring. For in the talk of those four hours he had
recognized the note of despair, and had seen that
Mr. Davis, though posing still in an imperious
and monumental attitude, was, in fact, standing
upon a disintegrated and crumbling pedestal. It
seemed not improbable that the disappointed supporters
of the rebel chief would gladly come back
to the old Union if they could be fairly received,
although at this conference they had felt compelled
by the exigencies of an official situation and their
representative character to say that they would
not. Accordingly Mr. Lincoln, having no idea
that a road to hearty national re-integration either
should or could be overshadowed by Caudine forks,
endeavored to make as easy as possible the return
<!-- Image No 329 --><a name='Png329'></a><a name='Page309'></a><span class="pagenum">309</span>of discouraged rebels, whether penitent or impenitent.
If they were truly penitent, all was as it
should be. If they were impenitent, he was willing
to trust to time to effect a change of heart.
Accordingly he worked out a scheme whereby
Congress should empower him to distribute between
the slave States $400,000,000, in proportion
to their respective slave populations, on
condition that &quot;all resistance to the national authority
[should] be abandoned and cease on or
before the first day of April next;&quot; one half the
sum to be paid when such resistance should so
cease; the other half whenever, on or before July
1 next, the Thirteenth Amendment should become
valid law. So soon as he should be clothed with
authority, he proposed to issue &quot;a proclamation
looking to peace and reunion,&quot; in which he would
declare that, upon the conditions stated, he would
exercise this power; that thereupon war should
cease and armies be reduced to a peace basis; that
all political offenses should be pardoned; that all
property, except slaves, liable to confiscation or
forfeiture, should be released therefrom (except in
cases of intervening interests of third parties); and
that liberality should be recommended to Congress
upon all points not lying within executive control.
On the evening of February 5 he submitted to
his cabinet a draft covering these points. His
disappointment may be imagined when he found
that not one of his advisers agreed with him; that
his proposition was &quot;unanimously disapproved.&quot;
<!-- Image No 330 --><a name='Png330'></a><a name='Page310'></a><span class="pagenum">310</span>
&quot;There may be such a thing,&quot; remarked Secretary
Welles, &quot;as so overdoing as to cause a distrust
or adverse feeling.&quot; It was also said that
the measure probably could not pass Congress;
that to attempt to carry it, without success, would
do harm; while if the offer should really be made,
it would be misconstrued by the rebels. In fact
scarcely any Republican was ready to meet the
rebels with the free and ample forgiveness which
Lincoln desired to offer; and later opinion seems
to be that his schemes were impracticable.</p>

<p>The fourth of March was close at hand, when
Mr. Lincoln was a second time to address the people
who had chosen him to be their ruler. That
black and appalling cloud, which four years ago
hung oppressively over the country, had poured
forth its fury and was now passing away. His
anxiety then had been lest the South, making itself
deaf to reason and to right, should force upon
the North a civil war; his anxiety now was lest
the North, hardening itself in a severe if not
vindictive temper, should deal so harshly with a
conquered South as to perpetuate a sectional antagonism.
To those who had lately come, bearing
to him the formal notification of his election, he
had remarked: &quot;Having served four years in the
depths of a great and yet unended national peril,
I can view this call to a second term in no wise
more flattering to myself than as an expression of
the public judgment that I may better finish a
difficult work, in which I have labored from the
<!-- Image No 331 --><a name='Png331'></a><a name='Page311'></a><span class="pagenum">311</span>first, than could any one less severely schooled to
the task.&quot; Now, mere conquest was not, in his
opinion, a finishing of the difficult work of restoring
a Union.</p>

<p>The second inaugural was delivered from the
eastern portico of the Capitol, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br />

<p>&quot;FELLOW COUNTRYMEN,&mdash;At this second appearing
to take the oath of the presidential office,
there is less occasion for an extended address than
there was at the first. Then, a statement, somewhat
in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed
fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four
years, during which public declarations have been
constantly called forth on every point and phase
of the great contest which still absorbs the attention
and engrosses the energies of the nation, little
that is new could be presented. The progress of
our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is
as well known to the public as to myself; and it
is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging
to all. With high hope for the future, no
prediction in regard to it is ventured.</p>

<p>&quot;On the occasion corresponding to this four
years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to
an impending civil war. All dreaded it,&mdash;all
sought to avert it. While the inaugural address
was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether
to saving the Union without war, insurgent
agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without
war&mdash;seeking to dissolve the Union, and
<!-- Image No 332 --><a name='Png332'></a><a name='Page312'></a><span class="pagenum">312</span>divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated
war; but one of them would make war
rather than let the nation survive; and the other
would accept war rather than let it perish. And
the war came.</p>

<p>&quot;One eighth of the whole population were
colored slaves, not distributed generally over the
Union, but localized in the southern part of it.
These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful
interest. All knew that this interest was, somehow,
the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate,
and extend this interest was the object for
which the insurgents would rend the Union, even
by war; while the government claimed no right
to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement
of it. Neither party expected for the war
the magnitude or the duration which it has already
attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of
the conflict might cease with, or even before, the
conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an
easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and
astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray
to the same God; and each invokes his aid against
the other. It may seem strange that any men
should dare to ask a just God's assistance in
wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's
faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged.
The prayers of both could not be answered,&mdash;that
of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty
has his own purposes. 'Woe unto the world
because of offenses! for it must needs be that
<!-- Image No 333 --><a name='Png333'></a><a name='Page313'></a><span class="pagenum">313</span>offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the
offense cometh.' If we shall suppose that American
slavery is one of those offenses which, in the
providence of God, must needs come, but which,
having continued through his appointed time, He
now wills to remove, and that He gives to both
North and South this terrible war, as the woe due
to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern
therein any departure from those divine attributes
which the believers in a living God always
ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently
do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may
speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it
continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's
two hundred and fifty years of unrequited
toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood
drawn with the lash shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand
years ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments
of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'</p>

<p>&quot;With malice toward none, with charity for all,
with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see
the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are
in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for
him who shall have borne the battle, and for his
widow, and his orphan,&mdash;to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among
ourselves, and with all nations.&quot;</p>

<br />

<p>This speech has taken its place among the most
famous of all the written or spoken compositions
<!-- Image No 334 --><a name='Png334'></a><a name='Page314'></a><span class="pagenum">314</span>in the English language. In parts it has often
been compared with the lofty portions of the Old
Testament. Mr. Lincoln's own contemporaneous
criticism is interesting. &quot;I expect it,&quot; he said,
&quot;to wear as well as, perhaps better than, anything
I have produced; but I believe it is not immediately
popular. Men are not flattered by being
shown that there has been a difference of purpose
between the Almighty and them. To deny it,
however, in this case is to deny that there is a
God governing the world. It is a truth which I
thought needed to be told; and as whatever of
humiliation there is in it falls most directly on
myself, I thought others might afford for me to
tell it.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2>EMANCIPATION COMPLETED</h2>

<p>On January 1, 1863, when the President issued
the Proclamation of Emancipation, he stepped to
the uttermost boundary of his authority in the
direction of the abolition of slavery. Indeed a
large proportion of the people believed that he had
trespassed beyond that boundary; and among the
defenders of the measure there were many who
felt bound to maintain it as a legitimate exercise
of the war power, while in their inmost souls they
thought that its real basis of justification lay in
its intrinsic righteousness. Perhaps the President
himself was somewhat of this way of thinking.
He once said: &quot;I felt that measure, otherwise
unconstitutional, might become lawful by becoming
indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution
through the preservation of the Union.... I
was, in my best judgment, driven to the
alternative of either surrendering the Union, and
with it the Constitution, or of laying strong hand
upon the colored element.&quot; Time, however,
proved that the act had in fact the character which
Mr. Lincoln attributed to it as properly a war
measure. It attracted the enlistment of negroes,
<!-- Image No 336 --><a name='Png336'></a><a name='Page316'></a><span class="pagenum">316</span>chiefly Southern negroes, in the army; and though
to the end of the war the fighting value of negro
troops was regarded as questionable, yet they were
certainly available for garrisons and for many
duties which would otherwise have absorbed great
numbers of white soldiers. Thus, as the President
said, the question became calculable mathematically,
like horse-power in a mechanical problem.
The force of able-bodied Southern negroes
soon reached 200,000, of whom most were in the
regular military service, and the rest were laborers
with the armies. &quot;We have the men,&quot; said
Mr. Lincoln, &quot;and we could not have had them
without the measure.&quot; Take these men from
us, &quot;and put them in the battlefield or cornfield
against us, and we should be compelled to abandon
the war in three weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>But the proclamation was operative only upon
certain individuals. The President's emancipatory
power covered only those persons (with, perhaps,
their families) whose freedom would be a
military loss to the South and a military gain to
the North in the pending war. He had no power
to touch the <i>institution of slavery</i>. That survived,
for the future, and must survive in spite of anything
that he alone, as President, could do.
Nevertheless, in designing movements for its permanent
destruction he was not less earnest than
were the radicals and extremists, though he was
unable to share their contempt for legalities and
for public opinion. It has been shown how strong
<!-- Image No 337 --><a name='Png337'></a><a name='Page317'></a><span class="pagenum">317</span>was his desire that legislative action for abolition
should be voluntarily initiated among the border
slave States themselves. This would save their
pride, and also would put a decisive end to all
chance of their ever allying themselves with the
Confederacy. He was alert to promote this purpose
whenever and wherever he conceived that any
opportunity offered for giving the first impulse.
In time rehabilitated governments of some States
managed with more or less show of regularity to
accomplish the reform. But it was rather a forced
transaction, having behind it an uncomfortably
small proportion of the adult male population of
the several States; and by and by the work, thus
done, might be undone; for such action was lawfully
revocable by subsequent legislatures or conventions,
which bodies would be just as potent at
any future time to re&euml;stablish slavery as the present
bodies were now potent to disestablish it. It
was entirely possible that reconstruction would
leave the right of suffrage in such shape that in
some States pro-slavery men might in time regain
control.</p>

<p>In short, the only absolute eradicating cure was
a constitutional amendment;<a name='FNanchor_77_77'></a><a href='#Footnote_77_77'><sup>[77]</sup></a> and, therefore, it
was towards securing this that the President bent
all his energies. He could use, of course, only
personal influence, not official authority; for the
<!-- Image No 338 --><a name='Png338'></a><a name='Page318'></a><span class="pagenum">318</span>business, as such, lay with Congress. In December,
1863, motions for such an amendment were
introduced in the House; and in January, 1864,
like resolutions were offered in the Senate. The
debate in the Senate was short; it opened on
March 28, and the vote was taken April 8; it
stood 38 ayes, 6 noes. This was gratifying; but
unfortunately the party of amendment had to face
a very different condition of feeling in the House.
The President, says Mr. Arnold, &quot;very often,
with the friends of the measure, canvassed the
House to see if the requisite number could be
obtained, but we could never count a two-thirds
vote.&quot; The debate began on March 19; not until
June 15 was the vote taken, and then it showed 93
ayes, 65 noes, being a discouraging deficiency of
27 beneath the requisite two thirds. Thereupon
Ashley of Ohio changed his vote to the negative,
and then moved a reconsideration, which left the
question to come up again in the next session.
Practically, therefore, at the adjournment of Congress,
the amendment was left as an issue before
the people in the political campaign of the summer
of 1864; and in that campaign it was second only
to the controlling question of peace or war.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, taking care to omit no effort in
this business, sent for Senator Morgan, the chairman
of the Republican National Committee, which
was to make the Republican nomination for the
presidency and to frame the Republican platform,
and said to him: &quot;I want you to mention in your
<!-- Image No 339 --><a name='Png339'></a><a name='Page319'></a><span class="pagenum">319</span>speech, when you call the convention to order, as
its keynote, and to put into the platform, as the
keystone, the amendment of the Constitution abolishing
and prohibiting slavery forever.&quot; Accordingly
the third plank in that platform declared
that slavery was the cause and the strength of the
rebellion, that it was &quot;hostile to the principle of
republican government,&quot; and that the &quot;national
safety demanded its utter and complete extirpation
from the soil of the Republic,&quot; and that to this
end the Constitution ought to be so amended as to
&quot;terminate and forever prohibit the existence of
slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the
United States.&quot; Thus at the special request of
the President the issue was distinctly presented to
the voters of the country. The Copperheads, the
conservatives, and reactionaries, and many of the
war Democrats, promptly opened their batteries
against both the man and the measure.</p>

<p>The Copperhead Democracy, as usual, went so
far as to lose force; they insisted that the Emancipation
Proclamation should be rescinded, and all
ex-slaves restored to their former masters. This,
in their opinion, would touch, a conciliatory chord
in Southern breasts, and might lead to pacification.
That even pro-slavery Northerners should
urgently advocate a proposition at once so cruel
and so disgraceful is hardly credible. Yet it was
reiterated strenuously, and again and again Mr.
Lincoln had to repeat his decisive and indignant
repudiation of it. In the message to Congress,
<!-- Image No 340 --><a name='Png340'></a><a name='Page320'></a><span class="pagenum">320</span>December, 1863, he said that to abandon the
freedmen now would be &quot;a cruel and astounding
breach of faith.... I shall not attempt to retract
or modify the Emancipation Proclamation,
nor shall I return to slavery any person who is
free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any
of the acts of Congress.&quot; In May, 1864, he
spurned the absurdity of depending &quot;upon coaxing,
flattery, and concession to get them [the Secessionists]
back into the Union.&quot; He said:
&quot;There have been men base enough to propose to
me to return to slavery our black warriors of Port
Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of
the masters they fought. Should I do so, I should
deserve to be damned in time and eternity. Come
what will, I will keep my faith with friend and
foe.&quot; He meant never to be misunderstood on
this point. Recurring to it after the election, in
his message to Congress in December, 1864, he
quoted his language of the year before and added:
&quot;If the people should, by whatever mode or means,
make it an executive duty to reinslave such persons,
another, and not I, must be their instrument
to perform it.&quot; All this was plain and spirited.
But it is impossible to praise Mr. Lincoln for contemning
a course which it is surprising to find any
person sufficiently ignoble to recommend. It was,
nevertheless, recommended by many, and thus
we may partly see what extremities of feeling were
produced by this most debasing question which has
ever entered into the politics of a civilized nation.</p>

<p><!-- Image No 341 --><a name='Png341'></a><a name='Page321'></a><span class="pagenum">321</span>
The anxieties of the war Democrats, who feared
that Mr. Lincoln was making abolition an essential
purpose of the war, have already been set
forth. In truth he was not making it so, but by
the drifting of events and the ensnarlment of facts
it had practically become so without his responsibility.
His many utterances which survive seem
to indicate that, having from the beginning hoped
that the war would put an end to slavery, he now
knew that it must do so. He saw that this conclusion
lay at the end of the natural course of
events, also that it was not a goal which was set
there by those to whom it was welcome, or which
could be taken away by those to whom it was
unwelcome. It was there by the absolute and
uncontrollable logic of facts. His function was
only to take care that this natural course should
not be obstructed, and this established goal should
not be maliciously removed away out of reach.
When he was asked why his expressions of willingness
to negotiate with the Confederate leaders
stipulated not only for the restoration of the Union
but also for the enfranchisement of all slaves, he
could only reply by intimating that the yoking of
the two requirements was unobjectionable from
any point of view, because he was entirely assured
that Mr. Davis would never agree to reunion,
either with or without slavery. Since, therefore,
Union could not be had until after the South had
been whipped, it would be just as well to demand
abolition also; for the rebels would not then be
<!-- Image No 342 --><a name='Png342'></a><a name='Page322'></a><span class="pagenum">322</span>in a position to refuse it, and we should practically
buy both in one transaction. To him it seemed
an appalling blunder to pay the price of this great
war simply in order to cure this especial outbreak
of the great national malady, and still to leave
existing in the body politic that which had induced
this dissension and would inevitably afterward
induce others like unto it. The excision of
the cause was the only intelligent action. Yet
when pushed to the point of declaring what he
would do in the supposed case of an opportunity
to restore the Union, with slavery, he said: &quot;My
enemies pretend I am now carrying on the war for
the sole purpose of abolition. So long as I am
President, it shall be carried on for the sole purpose
of restoring the Union.&quot; The duty of his
official oath compelled him to say this, but he often
and plainly acknowledged that he had no fear of
ever being brought face to face with the painful
necessity of saving both the Union and slavery.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that the persons who charged
upon the President that he would never assent to
a peace which was not founded upon the abolition
of slavery as one of its conditions or stipulations,
never distinctly stated by what right he could insist
upon such a condition or stipulation, or by
what process he could establish it or introduce it
into a settlement. Mr. Lincoln certainly never
had any thought of negotiating with the seceded
States as an independent country, and making
with them a treaty which could embody an article
<!-- Image No 343 --><a name='Png343'></a><a name='Page323'></a><span class="pagenum">323</span>establishing emancipation and permanent abolition.
He had not power to enter with them into
an agreement of an international character, nor,
if they should offer to return to the Union, retaining
their slave institutions, could he lawfully
reject them. The endeavor would be an act of
usurpation, if it was true that no State could go
out. The plain truth was that, from any save a
revolutionary point of view, the constitutional
amendment was the only method of effecting the
consummation permanently. When, in June,
1864, Mr. Lincoln said that abolition of slavery
was &quot;a fitting and necessary condition to the final
success of the Union cause,&quot; he was obviously
speaking of what was logically &quot;fitting and necessary,&quot;
and in the same sentence he clearly specified
a constitutional amendment as the practical
process. There is no indication that he ever had
any other scheme.</p>

<p>In effect, in electing members of Congress in
the autumn of 1864, the people passed upon the
amendment. Votes for Republicans were votes
for the amendment, and the great Republican gain
was fairly construed as an expression of the popular
favor towards the measure. But though the
elections thus made the permanent abolition of
slavery a reasonably sure event in the future, yet
delay always has dangers. The new Congress
would not meet for over a year. In the interval
the Confederacy might collapse, and abolition
become ensnarled with considerations of reconciliation,
<!-- Image No 344 --><a name='Png344'></a><a name='Page324'></a><span class="pagenum">324</span>
of reconstruction, of politics generally.
All friends of the measure, therefore, agreed on
the desirability of disposing of the matter while
the present Congress was in the way with it, if this
could possibly be compassed. That it could be
carried only by the aid of a contingent of Democratic
votes did not so much discourage them as
stimulate their zeal; for such votes would prevent
the mischief of a partisan or sectional aspect. In
his message to Congress, December 6, 1864, the
President referred to the measure which, after its
failure in the preceding session, was now to come
up again, by virtue of that shrewd motion for
reconsideration. Intelligibly, though not in terms,
he appealed for Democratic help. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Although the present is the same Congress
and nearly the same members, and without questioning
the wisdom or patriotism of those who
stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the
reconsideration and passage of the measure at the
present session. Of course the abstract question
is not changed; but an intervening election shows,
almost certainly, that the next Congress will pass
the measure if this does not. Hence there is only
a question of <i>time</i> as to when the proposed amendment
will go to the States for their action; and as
it is so to go, at all events, may we not agree that
the sooner the better. It is not claimed that the
election has imposed a duty on members to change
their views or their votes, any further than, as an
additional element to be considered, their judgment
<!-- Image No 345 --><a name='Png345'></a><a name='Page325'></a><span class="pagenum">325</span>
may be affected by it. It is the voice of the
people now for the first time heard upon the question.
In a great national crisis like ours unanimity
of action among those seeking a common end
is very desirable,&mdash;almost indispensable. And
yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable
unless some deference shall be paid to the will of
the majority. In this case the common end is the
maintenance of the Union, and among the means
to secure that end, such will, through the election,
is more clearly declared in favor of such a constitutional
amendment.&quot;</p>

<p>In the closing sentence the word &quot;maintenance&quot;
is significant. So far as the <i>restoration</i> of Union
went, the proclamation had done nearly all that
could be done. This amendment was to insure
the future <i>maintenance</i> of the Union by cutting
out the cause of disunion.</p>

<p>The President did not rest content with merely
reiterating sentiments which every man had long
known that he held. Of such influence as he could
properly exert among members of the House he
was not chary. The debate began on January 6,
1865, and he followed it closely and eagerly. On
the 27th it was agreed that the voting should take
place on the following day. No one yet felt sure
of the comparative strength of the friends and
opponents of the measure, and up to the actual
taking of the vote the result was uncertain. We
knew, says Arnold, &quot;we should get some Democratic
votes; but whether enough, none could tell.&quot;
<!-- Image No 346 --><a name='Png346'></a><a name='Page326'></a><span class="pagenum">326</span>Ex-Governor English of Connecticut, a Democrat,
gave the first Aye from his party; whereupon loud
cheers burst forth; then ten others followed his
example. Eight more Democrats gave their indirect
aid by being absent when their names were
called. Thus both the great parties united to
establish the freedom of all men in the United
States. As the roll-call drew to the end, those
who had been anxiously keeping tally saw that the
measure had been carried. The speaker, Mr.
Colfax, announced the result; ayes 119, noes 56,
and declared that &quot;the joint resolution is passed.&quot;
At once there arose from the distinguished crowd
an irrepressible outburst of triumphant applause;
there was no use in rapping to order, or trying to
turn to other business, and a motion to adjourn,
&quot;in honor of this immortal and sublime event,&quot;
was promptly made and carried. At the same
moment, on Capitol Hill, artillery roared loud
salutation to the edict of freedom.</p>

<p>The crowds poured to the White House, and
Mr. Lincoln, in a few words, of which the simplicity
fitted well with the grandness of the occasion,
congratulated them, in homely phrase, that &quot;the
great job is ended.&quot; Yet, though this was substantially
true, he did not live to see the strictly
legal completion. Ratification by the States was
still necessary, and though this began at once, and
proceeded in due course as their legislatures came
into session, yet the full three quarters of the
whole number had not passed the requisite resolutions
<!-- Image No 347 --><a name='Png347'></a><a name='Page327'></a><span class="pagenum">327</span>
at the time of his death. This, however,
was mere matter of form. The question was really
settled when Mr. Colfax announced the vote of
the representatives.<a name='FNanchor_78_78'></a><a href='#Footnote_78_78'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h2>THE FALL OF RICHMOND, AND THE ASSASSINATION
OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN</h2>


<p>From the Capitol, where he had spoken his
inaugural on March 4, 1865, Mr. Lincoln came
back to the White House with less than five weeks
of life before him; yet for those scant weeks most
men would have gladly exchanged their full lifetimes.
To the nation they came fraught with all
the intoxicating triumph of victory; but upon the
President they laid the vast responsibility of rightly
shaping and using success; and it was far less easy
to end the war wisely than it had been to conduct
it vigorously. Two populations, with numbers
and resources amply enough for two powerful
nations, after four years of sanguinary, relentless
conflict, in which each side had been inspired and
upheld by a faith like that of the first crusaders,
were now to be reunited as fellow citizens, and to
be fused into a homogeneous body politic based
upon universal suffrage. As if this did not verge
closely enough on the impossible, millions of
people of a hitherto servile race were suddenly
established in the new status of freedom. It was
very plain that the problems which were advancing
<!-- Image No 349 --><a name='Png349'></a><a name='Page329'></a><span class="pagenum">329</span>with approaching peace were more perplexing than
those which were disappearing with departing war.
Much would depend upon the spirit and terms of
the closing of hostilities.</p>

<p>If the limits of the President's authority were
vague, they might for that very reason be all the
more extensive; and, wherever they might be set,
he soon made it certain that he designed to part
with no power which he possessed. On the evening
of March 3 he went up, as usual, to the Capitol,
to sign bills during the closing hours of the
last session of the Thirty-eighth Congress. To
him thus engaged was handed a telegram from
General Grant, saying that General Lee had suggested
an interview between himself and Grant in
the hope that, upon an interchange of views, they
might reach a satisfactory adjustment of the present
unhappy difficulties through a military convention.
Immediately, exchanging no word with
any one, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The President directs me to say that he wishes
you to have no conference with General Lee, unless
it be for the capitulation of General Lee's
army, or on some minor or purely military matter.
He instructs me to say that you are not to decide,
discuss, or confer upon any political questions.
Such questions the President holds in his own
hands, and will submit them to no military conferences
or conventions. Meanwhile, you are to
press to the utmost your military advantages.&quot;</p>

<p>This reply he showed to Seward, then handed it
<!-- Image No 350 --><a name='Png350'></a><a name='Page330'></a><span class="pagenum">330</span>to Stanton and ordered him to sign and dispatch
it at once.</p>

<p>About this same time General Lee notified Mr.
Davis that Petersburg and Richmond could not be
held many more days. Indeed, they would probably
have been evacuated at once, had not the capital
carried so costly a freight of prestige as well
as of pride. It was no surprising secret which
was thus communicated to the chief rebel; all the
common soldiers in the Confederate army had for
a long while known it just as well as the general-in-chief
did; and they had been showing their
appreciation of the situation by deserting and
coming within the Union lines in such increasing
numbers that soon General Grant estimated that
the Confederate forces were being depleted by the
equivalent of nearly a regiment every day. The
civilian leaders had already suggested the last
expedients of despair,&mdash;the enrolling of boys of
fourteen years and old men of sixty-five, nay,
even the enlistment of slaves. But there was no
cure for the mortal dwindling. The Confederacy
was dying of anaemia.</p>

<p>Grant understood the situation precisely as his
opponents did. That Petersburg and Richmond
were about to be his was settled. But he was reaching
out for more than only these strongholds, and
that he could get Lee's army also was by no means
settled. As March opened he lay down every
night in the fear that, while he was sleeping, the
evacuation might be furtively, rapidly, in progress,
<!-- Image No 351 --><a name='Png351'></a><a name='Page331'></a><span class="pagenum">331</span>and the garrison escaping. He dreaded that, any
morning, he might awake to find delusive picket
lines, guarding nothing, while Lee and his soldiers
were already well in the lead, marching for the
South. For him, especially, it was a period of
extreme tension. Since the capture of Savannah
and the evacuation of Charleston several weeks
ago, Sherman with his fine army had been moving
steadily northward. In front of Sherman was
Johnston, with a considerable force which had
been got together from the remnants of Hood's
army and other sources. At Bentonsville a battle
took place, which resulted in Johnston's falling
back, but left him still formidable. General Grant
had not yet been able to break the Richmond and
Danville Railroad, which ran out from Richmond
in a southwesterly direction; and the danger was
that by this and the &quot;South Side&quot; railroad, Lee
might slip out, join Johnston, and overwhelm
Sherman before Grant could reach him. In time,
this peril was removed by the junction of Schofield's
army, coming from Wilmington, with that
of Sherman at Goldsboro. Yet, even after this
relief, there remained a possibility that Lee, uniting
with Johnston, and thus leading a still powerful
army of the more determined and constant
veterans, might prolong the war indefinitely.</p>

<p>Not without good reason was Grant harassed by
this thought, for in fact it was precisely this thing
that the good soldier in Petersburg was scheming
to do. The closing days of the month brought the
<!-- Image No 352 --><a name='Png352'></a><a name='Page332'></a><span class="pagenum">332</span>endeavor and the crisis. To improve his chances
Lee made a desperate effort to demoralize, at least
temporarily, the left or western wing of the Union
army, around which he must pass in order to get
away, when he should actually make his start.
March 25, therefore, he made so fierce an assault,
that he succeeded in piercing the Union lines and
capturing a fort. But it was a transitory gleam
of success; the Federals promptly closed in upon
the Confederates, and drove them back, capturing
and killing 4000 of them. In a few hours the
affair was all over; the Northern army showed the
dint no more than a rubber ball; but the Confederates
had lost brave men whom they could not
spare.</p>

<p>On March 22 Mr. Lincoln went to City Point;
no one could say just how soon important propositions
might require prompt answering, and it was
his purpose to be ready to have any such business
transacted as closely as possible in accordance with
his own ideas. On March 27 or 28, the famous
conference<a name='FNanchor_79_79'></a><a href='#Footnote_79_79'><sup>[79]</sup></a> was held on board the River Queen,
on James River, hard by Grant's headquarters,
between the President, General Grant, General
Sherman, who had come up hastily from Goldsboro,
and Admiral Porter. Not far away Sheridan's
fine body of 13,000 seasoned cavalrymen,
fresh from their triumphs in the Shenandoah Valley,
was even now crossing the James River, on
their way into the neighborhood of Dinwiddie
<!-- Image No 353 --><a name='Png353'></a><a name='Page333'></a><span class="pagenum">333</span>Court House, which lies southwest of Richmond,
and where they could threaten that remaining
railroad which was Lee's best chance of escape.
General Sherman reported that on April 10 he
should be ready to move to a junction with Grant.
But Grant, though he did not then proclaim it,
did not mean to wait so long; in fact he had the
secret wish and purpose that the Eastern army,
which had fought so long and so bloodily in Virginia,
should have all to itself the well-deserved
glory of capturing Richmond and conquering Lee,
a purpose which Mr. Lincoln, upon suggestion of
it, accepted.<a name='FNanchor_80_80'></a><a href='#Footnote_80_80'><sup>[80]</sup></a> The President then returned to
City Point, there to stay for the present, awaiting
developments.</p>

<p>On April 1 General Sheridan fought and won
the important battle at Five Forks. Throughout
that night, to prevent a too vigorous return-assault
upon Sheridan, the Federal batteries thundered all
along the line; and at daybreak on the morning
of April 2 the rebel intrenchments were fiercely
assaulted. After hard fighting the Confederates
were forced back upon their inner lines. Then
General Grant sent a note to City Point, saying:
&quot;I think the President might come out and pay
us a visit to morrow;&quot; and then also General Lee,
upon his part, sent word to Jefferson Davis that
the end had come, that Petersburg and Richmond
must be abandoned immediately.</p>

<p>The news had been expected at any moment by
<!-- Image No 354 --><a name='Png354'></a><a name='Page334'></a><span class="pagenum">334</span>the Confederate leaders, but none the less it produced
intense excitement. Away went Mr. Davis,
in hot haste, also the members of his cabinet and
of his congress, and the officials of the rebel State
of Virginia, and, in short, every one who felt himself
of consequence enough to make it worth his
while to run away. The night was theirs, and
beneath its friendly shade they escaped, with archives
and documents which had suddenly become
valuable chiefly for historical purposes. Grant had
ordered that on the morning of April 3 a bombardment
should begin at five o'clock, which was to be
followed by an assault at six o'clock. But there
was no occasion for either; even at the earlier hour
Petersburg was empty, and General Grant and
General Meade soon entered it undisturbed. A
little later Mr. Lincoln joined them, and they
walked through streets in which neither man nor
animal, save only this little knot, was to be seen.<a name='FNanchor_81_81'></a><a href='#Footnote_81_81'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p>At quarter after eight o'clock, that same morning,
General Weitzel, with a few attendants, rode
into the streets of Richmond. That place, however,
was by no means deserted, but, on the contrary,
it seemed Pandemonium. The rebels had
been blowing up and burning warships and stores;
they had also gathered great quantities of cotton
<!-- Image No 355 --><a name='Png355'></a><a name='Page335'></a><span class="pagenum">335</span>and tobacco into the public storehouses and had
then set them on fire. More than 700 buildings
were feeding a conflagration at once terrible and
magnificent to behold, and no one was endeavoring
to stay its advance. The negroes were intoxicated
with joy, and the whites with whiskey; the
convicts from the penitentiary had broken loose; a
mob was breaking into houses and stores and was
pillaging madly. Erelong the Fifth Massachusetts
Cavalry, a negro regiment under Colonel C.F.
Adams, Jr., paraded through the streets, and
then the Southern whites hid themselves within
doors to shun the repulsive spectacle. It may be
that armed and hostile negroes brought to them
the dread terror of retaliation and massacre in the
wild hour of triumph. But if so, their fear was
groundless; the errand of the Northern troops
was, in fact, one of safety and charity; they began
at once to extinguish the fires, to suppress the
riot, and to feed the starving people.</p>

<p>On the following day President Lincoln started
on his way up the river from City Point, upon an
excursion to the rebel capital. Obstructions which
had been placed in the stream stopped the progress
of his steamer; whereupon he got into a barge and
was rowed to one of the city wharves. He had
not been expected, and with a guard of ten sailors,
and with four gentlemen as comrades, he
walked through the streets, under the guidance of
a &quot;contraband,&quot; to the quarters of General Weitzel.
This has been spoken of as an evidence of
<!-- Image No 356 --><a name='Png356'></a><a name='Page336'></a><span class="pagenum">336</span>bravery; but, regarded in this light, it was only
superfluous evidence of a fact which no one ever
doubted; it really deserves better to be called foolhardiness,
as Captain Penrose, who was one of the
party, frankly described it in his Diary. The
walk was a mile and a half long, and this gentleman
says: &quot;I never passed a more anxious time
than in this walk. In going up [the river] ... we
ran the risk of torpedoes and the obstructions;
but I think the risk the President ran in going
through the streets of Richmond was even greater,
and shows him to have great courage. The streets
of the city were filled with drunken rebels, both
officers and men, and all was confusion.... A
large portion of the city was still on fire.&quot; Probably
enough the impunity with which this great
risk was run was due to the dazing and bewildering
effect of an occasion so confused and exciting.
Meantime, Lee, abandoning Petersburg, but by
no means abandoning &quot;the Cause,&quot; pushed his
troops with the utmost expedition to gain that
southwestern route which was the slender thread
whence all Confederate hope now depended. His
men traveled light and fast; for, poor fellows, they
had little enough to carry! But Grant was an
eager pursuer. Until the sixth day that desperate
flight and chase continued. Lee soon saw that he
could not get to Danville, as he had hoped to do,
and thereupon changed his plan and struck nearly
westward, for open country, via Appomattox Court
House. All the way, as he marched, Federal
<!-- Image No 357 --><a name='Png357'></a><a name='Page337'></a><span class="pagenum">337</span>horsemen worried the left flank of his columns,
while the infantry came ever closer upon the rear,
and kept up a ceaseless skirmishing. It had become
&quot;a life and death struggle with Lee to get
south to his provisions;&quot; and Grant was struggling
with not less stern zeal, along a southerly
line, to get ahead of him in this racing journey.
The Federal troops, sanguine and excited, did their
part finely, even marching a whole day and night
without rations. On April 6 there was an engagement,
in which about 7000 Southerners, with six
general officers, surrendered; and perhaps the
captives were not deeply sorry for their fate.
Sheridan telegraphed: &quot;If the thing is pressed, I
think that Lee will surrender.&quot; Grant repeated
this to the President, who replied: &quot;Let the thing
be pressed,&quot;&mdash;not that there was any doubt about
it! Yet, April 7, General Lee was cheered by an
evanescent success in an engagement. It was
trifling, however, and did not suffice to prevent
many of his generals from uniting to advise him
to capitulate. Grant also sent to him a note saying
that resistance was useless, and that he desired
to shift from himself the responsibility of further
bloodshed by asking for a surrender. Lee denied
the hopelessness, but asked what terms would be
offered. At the same time he continued his rapid
retreat. On April 8, about sunset, near Appomattox
Station, his advance encountered Sheridan's
cavalry directly across the road. The corral
was complete. Nevertheless, there ensued a few
<!-- Image No 358 --><a name='Png358'></a><a name='Page338'></a><span class="pagenum">338</span>critical hours; for Sheridan could by no means
stand against Lee's army. Fortunately, however,
these hours of crisis were also the hours of darkness,
in which troops could march but could not
fight, and at dawn, on April 9, the Southerners
saw before them a great force of Federal soldiery
abundantly able to hold them in check until
Grant's whole army could come up. &quot;A sharp
engagement ensued,&quot; says General Grant, &quot;but
Lee quickly set up a white flag.&quot; He then notified
Sheridan, in his front, and Meade, in his rear,
that he had sent a note to General Grant with a
view to surrender, and he asked a suspension of
hostilities. These commanders doubted a ruse,
and reluctantly consented to hold their troops back
for two hours. That was just enough; pending
the recess Grant was reached by the bearer of the
dispatch, and at once rode in search of Lee.</p>

<p>The two met at the house of a villager and easily
came to terms, for Grant's offer transcended in
liberality anything which Lee could fairly have
expected. General Grant hastily wrote it out in
the form of a letter to Lee: The Confederates,
officers and men, were to be paroled, &quot;not to take
up arms against the government of the United
States until properly exchanged;&quot; arms, artillery,
and public property were to be turned over to the
Federals except the side-arms of the officers, their
private horses, and baggage. &quot;This done, each
officer and man will be allowed to return to their
homes, not to be disturbed by United States authority
<!-- Image No 359 --><a name='Png359'></a><a name='Page339'></a><span class="pagenum">339</span>
so long as they observe their parole and the
laws in force where they may reside.&quot; This closing
sentence practically granted amnesty to all
persons then surrendering, not excluding even the
rebel general-in-chief. It was afterward severely
criticised as trenching upon the domain of the
President, and perhaps, also, on that of Congress.
For it was practically an exercise of the pardoning
power; and it was, or might be, an element in
reconstruction. Not improbably the full force of
the language was not appreciated when it was written;
but whether this was so or not, and whether
authority had been unduly assumed or not, an
engagement of General Grant was sure to be respected,
especially when it was entirely in harmony
with the spirit of the President's policy, though it
happened to be contrary to the letter of his order.</p>

<p>General Lee had no sooner surrendered than he
asked for food for his starving troops; and stated,
by way of estimate, that about twenty-five thousand
rations would be needed. The paroles, as
signed, showed a total of 28,231. To so trifling
a force had his once fine army been reduced by
the steady drain of battles and desertions.<a name='FNanchor_82_82'></a><a href='#Footnote_82_82'><sup>[82]</sup></a> The
veterans had long since understood that their lives
were a price which could buy nothing, and which
therefore might as well be saved.</p>

<p>The fall of Richmond and the surrender of Lee
<!-- Image No 360 --><a name='Png360'></a><a name='Page340'></a><span class="pagenum">340</span>were practically the end of the war. Remnants
of secession indeed remained, of which Mr. Lincoln
did not live to see the disposition. Johnston's
army was still in the field; but on learning that
there really was no longer either a Confederacy or
a cause to fight for, it surrendered on April 26.
Jefferson Davis also arranged for himself<a name='FNanchor_83_83'></a><a href='#Footnote_83_83'><sup>[83]</sup></a> the
most effectual of all amnesties by making himself
ridiculous; for though some persons had designed
a serious punishment for this dethroned ruler, they
recognized that this became impossible after he
had put himself into petticoats. It was hardly fair
that Mr. Lincoln was robbed of the amusement
which he would have gathered from this exploit.</p>

<p>On April 11, in the evening, a multitude gathered
before the White House, bringing loud congratulations,
and not to be satisfied without a
speech from the President. Accordingly he came
out and spoke to the cheering crowd, and by a few
simple, generous words, turned over the enthusiastic
acclamation, which seemed to honor him, to
those &quot;whose harder part&quot; had given the cause of
rejoicing. &quot;Their honors,&quot; he said, &quot;must not
be parceled out with others. I myself was near
the front, and had the high pleasure of transmitting
much of the good news to you; but no part
of the honor, for plan or execution, is mine. To
General Grant, his skillful officers and brave men,
all belongs. The gallant navy stood ready, but
was not in reach to take an active part.&quot; He then
<!-- Image No 361 --><a name='Png361'></a><a name='Page341'></a><span class="pagenum">341</span>at once turned to the subject of reconstruction,
and the last words which he addressed to the people
were mingled of argument and appeal in behalf
of the humane and liberal policy which he had
inaugurated in Louisiana, which was still in the
experimental stage, yet which had already excited
the bitter denunciations of the politicians.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>So soon as it was known in the autumn of 1860
that Abraham Lincoln was to be the next president
of the United States, he was at once beset by
two pests: the office-seekers, and the men who
either warned him to fear assassination or anonymously
threatened him with it. Of the two, the
office-seekers annoyed him by far the more; they
came like the plague of locusts, and devoured his
time and his patience. His contempt and disgust
towards them were unutterable; he said that the
one purpose in life with at least one half of the
nation seemed to be that they should live comfortably
at the expense of the other half. But it was
the fashion of the people, and he was obliged to
endure the affliction, however it might stir his
indignation and contempt. The matter of assassination
he was more free to treat as he chose. A
curious incident, strangely illustrating the superstitious
element in his nature, was narrated by him
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;It was just after my election in 1860, when
the news had been coming in thick and fast all
day, and there had been a great 'hurrah boys!'
<!-- Image No 362 --><a name='Png362'></a><a name='Page342'></a><span class="pagenum">342</span>so that I was well tired out and went home to rest,
throwing myself upon a lounge in my chamber.
Opposite to where I lay was a bureau with a swinging
glass upon it; and, in looking in that glass, I
saw myself reflected nearly at full length; but my
face, I noticed, had two separate and distinct images,
the tip of the nose of one being about three
inches from the tip of the other. I was a little
bothered, perhaps startled, and got up and looked
in the glass; but the illusion vanished. On lying
down again I saw it a second time, plainer, if
possible, than before; and then I noticed that one
of the faces was a little paler&mdash;say five shades&mdash;than
the other. I got up and the thing melted
away; and I went off, and in the excitement of
the hour forgot all about it,&mdash;nearly, but not
quite, for the thing would once in a while come up,
and give me a little pang, as though something
uncomfortable had happened. When I went home,
I told my wife about it; and a few days after I
tried the experiment again, when, sure enough,
the thing came back again; but I never succeeded
in bringing the ghost back after that, though I
once tried very industriously to show it to my wife,
who was worried about it somewhat. She thought
it was 'a sign' that I was to be elected to a second
term of office, and that the paleness of one of the
faces was an omen that I should not see life
through the last term.&quot;</p>

<p>From this time forth anonymous threats and
friendly warnings came thick and fast up to the
<!-- Image No 363 --><a name='Png363'></a><a name='Page343'></a><span class="pagenum">343</span>fatal day when the real event befell. Some of
these he kept, and after his death they were found
in his desk, labeled &quot;Assassination Letters.&quot;
Before he left Springfield for his journey to
Washington, many ingenious fears were suggested
to him; but, except for his change of route toward
the close of his journey, none of these presagings
visibly influenced him, and his change of purpose
concerning the passage through Baltimore was
never afterward recalled by him without vexation.
From that time forth he resolutely ignored all
danger of this kind. During most of the time
that he was in office any one could easily call upon
him, unguarded, at the White House; he moved
through the streets of Washington like any private
citizen; and he drove about the environs, and
habitually in the warm season took the long drive
to and from the Soldiers' Home, with substantially
no protection. When, at last, a guard at
the White House and an escort upon his drives
were fairly forced upon him by Mr. Stanton (who
was declared by the gossip of the unfriendly to
be somewhat troubled with physical timidity), he
rebelled against these incumbrances upon his freedom,
and submitted, when he had to do so, with
an ill grace. To those who remonstrated with
him upon his carelessness he made various replies.
Sometimes, half jocosely, he said that it was
hardly likely that any intelligent Southerner would
care to get rid of him in order to set either Vice-President
Hamlin or, later, Vice-President Johnson,
<!-- Image No 364 --><a name='Png364'></a><a name='Page344'></a><span class="pagenum">344</span>
in his place. At other times he said: &quot;What
is the use of setting up the <i>gap</i>, when the fence is
down all round?&quot; or, &quot;I do not see that I can
make myself secure except by shutting myself up
in an iron box, and in that condition I think I
could hardly satisfactorily transact the business of
the presidency.&quot; Again he said: &quot;If I am killed,
I can die but once; but to live in constant dread
of it, is to die over and over again.&quot; This was an
obvious reflection, easy enough of suggestion for
any one who was not within the danger line; but
to live every day in accordance with it, when the
danger was never absent, called for a singular
tranquillity of temperament, and a kind of courage
in which brave men are notoriously apt to be
deficient.</p>

<p>On April 9 the President was coming up the
Potomac in a steamer from City Point; the Comte
de Chambrun was of the party and relates that,
as they were nearing Washington, Mrs. Lincoln,
who had been silently gazing toward the town,
said: &quot;That city is filled with our enemies;&quot;
whereupon Mr. Lincoln &quot;somewhat impatiently
retorted: 'Enemies! we must never speak of
that!'&quot; For he was resolutely cherishing the
impossible idea that Northerners and Southerners
were to be enemies no longer, but that a pacification
of the spirit was coming throughout the
warring land contemporaneously with the cessation
of hostilities,&mdash;a dream romantic and hopelessly
incapable of realization, but humane and beautiful.
<!-- Image No 365 --><a name='Png365'></a><a name='Page345'></a><span class="pagenum">345</span>Since he did not live to endeavor to transform
it into a fact, and thereby perhaps to have his
efforts cause even seriously injurious results, it is
open to us to forget the impracticability of the
fancy and to revere the nature which in such an
hour could give birth to such a purpose.</p>

<p>The fourteenth day of April was Friday,&mdash;Good
Friday. Many religious persons afterward
ventured to say that if the President had not been
at the theatre upon that sacred day, the awful
tragedy might never have occurred at all. Others,
however, not less religiously disposed, were impressed
by the coincidence that the fatal shot was
fired upon that day which the Christian world had
agreed to adopt as the anniversary of the crucifixion
of the Saviour of mankind. General Grant
and his wife were in Washington on that day and
the President invited them to go with him to see
the play at Ford's theatre in the evening, but personal
engagements called them northward. In the
afternoon the President drove out with his wife,
and again the superstitious element comes in; for
he appeared in such good spirits, as he chatted
cheerfully of the past and the future, that she
uneasily remarked to him: &quot;I have seen you thus
only once before; it was just before our dear
Willie died.&quot; Such a frame of mind, however,
under the circumstances at that time must be regarded
as entirely natural rather than as ominous.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock in the evening the President
entered his box at the theatre; with him were his
<!-- Image No 366 --><a name='Png366'></a><a name='Page346'></a><span class="pagenum">346</span>wife, Major Rathbone, and a lady; the box had
been decorated with an American flag, of which
the folds swept down to the stage. Unfortunately
it had also been tampered with, in preparation for
the plans of the conspirators. Between it and the
corridor was a small vestibule; and a stout stick
of wood had been so arranged that it could in an
instant be made to fasten securely, on the inside,
the door which opened from the corridor into this
vestibule. Also in the door which led from the
vestibule into the box itself a hole had been cut,
through which the situation of the different persons
in the box could be clearly seen. Soon after
the party had entered, when the cheering had subsided
and the play was going forward, just after
ten o'clock, a man approached through the corridor,
pushed his visiting card into the hands of the
attendant who sat there, hastily entered the vestibule,
and closed and fastened the door behind him.
A moment later the noise of a pistol shot astounded
every one, and instantly a man was seen at the
front of the President's box; Major Rathbone
sprang to grapple with him, but was severely
slashed in the arm and failed to retard his progress;
he vaulted over the rail to the stage, but
caught his spur in the folds of the flag, so that he
did not alight fairly upon his feet; but he instantly
recovered himself, and with a visible limp in his
gait hastened across the stage; as he went, he
turned towards the audience, brandished the bloody
dagger with which he had just struck Rathbone,
<!-- Image No 367 --><a name='Png367'></a><a name='Page347'></a><span class="pagenum">347</span>and cried &quot;<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>&quot; Some one
recognized John Wilkes Booth, an actor of melodramatic
characters. The door at the back of the
theatre was held open for him by Edward Spangler,
an employee, and in the alley hard by a boy,
also employed about the theatre, was holding the
assassin's horse, saddled and bridled. Booth
kicked the boy aside, with a curse, climbed into
the saddle with difficulty,&mdash;for the small bone of
his leg between the knee and ankle had been
broken in his fall upon the stage,&mdash;and rode
rapidly away into the night. Amid the confusion,
no efficient pursuit was made.</p>

<p>The President had been shot at the back of the
head, on the left side; the bullet passed through
the brain, and stopped just short of the left eye.
Unconsciousness of course came instantaneously.
He was carried to a room in a house opposite the
theatre, and there he continued to breathe until
twenty-two minutes after seven o'clock in the
morning, at which moment he died.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>The man Booth, who had done this deed of
blood and madness, was an unworthy member of
the family of distinguished actors of that name.
He was young, handsome, given to hard drinking,
of inordinate vanity, and of small capacity in his
profession; altogether, he was a disreputable fellow,
though fitted to seem a hero in the eyes of
the ignorant and dissipated classes. Betwixt the
fumes of the brandy which he so freely drank and
<!-- Image No 368 --><a name='Png368'></a><a name='Page348'></a><span class="pagenum">348</span>the folly of the melodramatic parts which he was
wont to act, his brain became saturated with a
passion for notoriety, which grew into the very
mania of egotism. His crime was as stupid as it
was barbarous; and even from his own point of
view his achievement was actually worse than a
failure. As an act of revenge against a man
whom he hated, he accomplished nothing, for he
did not inflict upon Mr. Lincoln so much as one
minute of mental distress or physical suffering.
To the South he brought no good, and at least ran
the risk of inflicting upon it much evil, since he
aroused a vindictive temper among persons who
had the power to carry vindictiveness into effect;
and he slew the only sincere and powerful friend
whom the Southerners had among their conquerors.
He passed a miserable existence for eleven
days after the assassination, moving from one hiding-place
to another, crippled and suffering, finding
concealment difficult and escape impossible.
Moreover, he had the intense mortification to find
himself regarded with execration rather than admiration,
loathed as a murderer instead of admired
as a hero, and charged with having wrought irreparable
hurt to those whom he had foolishly
fancied that he was going to serve conspicuously.
It was a curious and significant fact that there was
among the people of the North a considerable body
of persons who, though undoubtedly as shocked
as was every one else at the method by which the
President had been eliminated from the political
<!-- Image No 369 --><a name='Png369'></a><a name='Page349'></a><span class="pagenum">349</span>situation, were yet well pleased to see Andrew
Johnson come into power;<a name='FNanchor_84_84'></a><a href='#Footnote_84_84'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and these persons
were the very ones who had been heretofore most
extreme in their hostility to slavery, most implacable
towards the people of the Confederacy.
There were no persons living to whom Booth
would have been less willing to minister gratification
than to these men. Their new President, it
is true, soon disappointed them bitterly, but for
the moment his accession was generally regarded
as a gain for their party.</p>

<p>Late on April 25 a squad of cavalry traced
Booth to a barn in Virginia; they surrounded it,
but he refused to come out; thereupon they set
fire to it, and then one of them, Boston Corbett,
contrary to orders, thrust his musket through a
crevice and fired at Booth. Probably he hit his
mark, though some think that the hunted wretch
at this last desperate moment shot himself with
his own revolver. Be this as it may, the assassin
was brought forth having a bullet in the base of
his brain, and with his body below the wound
paralyzed. He died on the morning of April 26.</p>

<p>While the result of Booth's shot secured for
him that notoriety which he loved, the enterprise
<!-- Image No 370 --><a name='Png370'></a><a name='Page350'></a><span class="pagenum">350</span>was in fact by no means wholly his own. A conspiracy
involving many active members, and known
also to others, had been long in existence. For
months plans had been laid and changed, and
opportunities had been awaited and lost. Had
the plot not been thus delayed, its success might
have done more practical mischief. Now, in
addition to what the plotters lost by reason of
this delay, only a part of their whole great scheme
was carried out. At the same time that the tragedy
was enacting at Ford's Theatre an assault
was perpetrated upon Mr. Seward, who was then
confined to his bed by hurts lately received in an
accident. The assassin gained admission into the
house under pretense of bringing medicine; thus
he reached the bedroom, and at once threw himself
upon the secretary, whom he stabbed about the
face and neck; then encountering in turn two sons
of Mr. Seward and two men nurses, he wounded
them all more or less seriously, and escaped. But
much as had been done, as much or more was
left undone; for there can be little doubt that the
plot also included the murder of the Vice-President,
General Grant, and Secretary Stanton; the
idea being, so far as there was any idea or any
sense at all in the villainy, that the sudden destruction
of all these men would leave the government
with no lawful head, and that anarchy would
ensue.</p>

<p>Not many days elapsed before the government
had in custody seven men, Herold, Spangler,
<!-- Image No 371 --><a name='Png371'></a><a name='Page351'></a><span class="pagenum">351</span>Payne, O'Laughlin, Arnold, Atzerodt, and Mudd,
and one woman, Mary E. Surratt, all charged with
being concerned in the conspiracy. But though
they had been so happily caught, there was much
difficulty in determining just how to deal with
them. Such was the force of secession feeling in
the District of Columbia that no jury there could
be expected to find them guilty, unless the panel
should be packed in a manner which would be
equally against honesty and good policy. After
some deliberation, therefore, the government decided
to have recourse to a military commission,
provided this were possible under the law, and
the attorney-general, under guise of advising the
administration, understood distinctly that he must
find that it was possible. Accordingly he wrote
a long, sophistical, absurd opinion, in which he
mixed up the law of nations and the &quot;laws of
war,&quot; and emerged out of the fog very accurately
at the precise point at which he was expected to
arrive. Not that fault should be found with him
for performing this feat; it was simply one of
many instances, furnished by the war, of the
homage which necessity pays to law and which law
repays to necessity. That which must be done
must also be stoutly and ingeniously declared to
be legal. It was intolerable that the men should
escape, yet their condemnation must be accomplished
in a respectable way. So the Military
Commission was promptly convened, heard the
evidence which could be got together at such short
<!-- Image No 372 --><a name='Png372'></a><a name='Page352'></a><span class="pagenum">352</span>notice, and found all the accused guilty, as undoubtedly
they were. The men were a miserable
parcel of fellows, belonging in that class of the
community called &quot;roughs,&quot; except only Mudd,
who was a country doctor. Mrs. Surratt was a
fit companion for such company. Herold, Atzerodt
and Payne were hanged on July 7; O'Laughlin,
Spangler, Arnold, and Mudd were sent to the
Dry Tortugas, there to be kept at hard labor in
the military prison for life, save Spangler, whose
term was six years. Mrs. Surratt was also found
guilty and condemned to be hanged. Five members
of the commission signed a petition to President
Johnson to commute this sentence, but he
refused, and on July 7 she also met the fate which
no one could deny that she deserved. John H.
Surratt escaped for the time, but was apprehended
and tried in the District of Columbia, in 1867;
he had then the advantage of process under the
regular criminal law, and the result was that on
September 22, 1868, a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered,
and he was set free, to swell the multitude of
villains whose impunity reflects no great credit
upon our system of dealing with crime.</p>

<p>Besides those who have been named, the government
also charged several other persons with
complicity in the plot. Among these were Jefferson
Davis and some members of that notorious
colony of Confederates who, in the wholesome and
congenial safety of Canada, had been plotting
mean crimes during the war. Of course, since
<!-- Image No 373 --><a name='Png373'></a><a name='Page353'></a><span class="pagenum">353</span>these men could not be captured and actually
placed upon trial, there was little object in seeking
evidence against them, and only so much was
produced as came to the possession of the government
incidentally in the way of its endeavor to
convict those prisoners who were in its possession.
Under these circumstances there was not sufficient
evidence to prove that any one of them aided or
abetted, or had a guilty knowledge of, the conspiracy;
yet certainly there was evidence enough
to place them under such suspicion, that, if they
were really innocent, they deserve commiseration
for their unfortunate situation.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>It is startling to contemplate the responsibility
so lightly taken by the mad wretch who shortly
and sharply severed the most important life which
any man was living on the fourteenth day of April,
1865. Very rarely, in the course of the ages, have
circumstances so converged upon a single person
and a special crisis as to invest them with the importance
which rested upon this great leader at this
difficult time. Yet, in the briefest instant that
can be measured, an ignoble tippler had dared to
cut the life-thread from which depended no small
portion of the destinies of millions of people.
How the history of this nation might have been
changed, had Mr. Lincoln survived to bear his
influential part in reconstructing and reuniting
the shattered country, no man can tell. Many
have indulged in the idle speculation, though to
<!-- Image No 374 --><a name='Png374'></a><a name='Page354'></a><span class="pagenum">354</span>do so is but to waste time. The life which he had
already lived gives food enough for reflection and
for study without trying to evolve out of arbitrary
fancy the further things which might have been
attempted by him, which might have been of wise
or of visionary conception, might have brilliantly
succeeded or sadly failed.</p>

<p>It is only forty years since Abraham Lincoln
became of much note in the world, yet in that
brief time he has been the subject of more varied
discussion than has been expended upon any other
historical character, save, perhaps, Napoleon; and
the kind of discussion which has been called forth
by Lincoln is not really to be likened to that which
has taken place concerning Napoleon or concerning
any other person whomsoever. The great men
of the various eras and nations are comprehensible,
at least upon broad lines. The traits to
which each owes his peculiar power can be pretty
well agreed upon; the capacity of each can be
tolerably well expressed in a formula; each can be
intelligibly described in fairly distinct phrases;
and whether this be in the spirit of admiration or
of condemnation will, in all cases which admit of
doubt, be largely a question of the personal sympathies
of the observer. But Lincoln stands apart
in striking solitude,&mdash;an enigma to all men. The
world eagerly asks of each person who endeavors
to write or speak of him: What illumination have
you for us? Have you solved the mystery? Can
you explain this man? The task has been essayed
<!-- Image No 375 --><a name='Png375'></a><a name='Page355'></a><span class="pagenum">355</span>many times; it will be essayed many times more;
it never has been, and probably it never will be
entirely achieved. Each biographer, each writer or
speaker, makes his little contribution to the study,
and must be content to regard it merely as a contribution.
For myself, having drawn the picture
of the man as I see him, though knowing well that
I am far from seeing him all, and still farther from
seeing inwardly through him, yet I know that I
cannot help it by additional comments. Very much
more than is the case with other men, Lincoln
means different things to different persons, and the
aspect which he presents depends to an unusual
degree upon the moral and mental individuality of
the observer. Perhaps this is due to the breadth
and variety of his own nature. As a friend once
said to me: Lincoln was like Shakespeare, in that
he seemed to run through the whole gamut of
human nature. It was true. From the superstition
of the ignorant backwoodsman to that profoundest
faith which is the surest measure of man's greatness,
Lincoln passed along the whole distance. In
his early days he struck his roots deep down into
the common soil of the earth, and in his latest years
his head towered and shone among the stars. Yet
his greatest, his most distinctive, and most abiding
trait was his humanness of nature; he was the
expression of his people; at some periods of his
life and in some ways it may be that he expressed
them in their uglier forms, but generally he displayed
them in their noblest and most beautiful
<!-- Image No 376 --><a name='Png376'></a><a name='Page356'></a><span class="pagenum">356</span>developments; yet, for worse or for better, one is
always conscious of being in close touch with him
as a fellow man. People often call him the greatest
man who ever lived; but, in fact, he was not
properly to be compared with any other. One
may set up a pole and mark notches upon it, and
label them with the names of Julius Caesar, William
of Orange, Cromwell, Napoleon, even Washington,
and may measure these men against each
other, and dispute and discuss their respective
places. But Lincoln cannot be brought to this
pole, he cannot be entered in any such competition.
This is not necessarily because he was greater
than any of these men; for, before this could be
asserted, the question would have to be settled:
How is greatness to be estimated? One can
hardly conceive that in any age of the world or
any combination of circumstances a capacity and
temperament like that of Caesar or Napoleon would
not force itself into prominence and control. On
the other hand, it is easy to suppose that, if precisely
such a great moral question and peculiar
crisis as gave to Lincoln his opportunity had not
arisen contemporaneously with his years of vigor,
he might never have got farther away from obscurity
than does the ordinary member of Congress.
Does this statement limit his greatness, by requiring
a rare condition to give it play? The question
is of no serious consequence, since the condition
existed; and the discussion which calls it forth is
also of no great consequence. For what is gained
<!-- Image No 377 --><a name='Png377'></a><a name='Page357'></a><span class="pagenum">357</span>by trying to award him a number in a rank-list
of heroes? It is enough to believe that probably
Lincoln alone among historical characters could
have done that especial task which he had to do.
It was a task of supreme difficulty, and like none
which any other man ever had to undertake; and
he who was charged with it was even more distantly
unlike any other man in both moral and
mental equipment. We cannot force lines to be
parallel, for our own convenience or curiosity,
when in fact they are not parallel. Let us not
then try to compare and to measure him with
others, and let us not quarrel as to whether he
was greater or less than Washington, as to whether
either of them, set to perform the other's
task, would have succeeded with it, or, perchance,
would have failed. Not only is the competition
itself an ungracious one, but to make Lincoln a
competitor is foolish and useless. He was the
most individual man who ever lived; let us be
content with this fact. Let us take him simply
as Abraham Lincoln, singular and solitary, as we
all see that he was; let us be thankful if we can
make a niche big enough for him among the
world's heroes, without worrying ourselves about
the proportion which it may bear to other niches;
and there let him remain forever, lonely, as in his
strange lifetime, impressive, mysterious, unmeasured,
and unsolved.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
